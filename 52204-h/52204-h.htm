  <h3 class='c007'>SIMPLE RULES FOR INTERPRETING ACTS OF<br /> PARLIAMENT.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Always avoid reading the preamble, which is likely to confuse
rather than to enlighten. It sets forth not what the act is to do, but
what it undoes: and confuses you with what the law was, instead
of telling you what it is to be.</p>

<p class='c000'>When you come to a very long clause, skip it altogether, for it is
sure to be unintelligible. If you try to attach one meaning to it,
the lawyers are sure to attach another; and, therefore, if you are
desirous of obeying an act of Parliament, it will be safer not to look
at it, but wait until a few contrary decisions have been come to, and
then act upon the latest.</p>

<p class='c000'>When any clause says either one thing or the other shall be right,
you may make sure that both will be wrong.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>HINTS ON ECONOMY.</h3>

<p class='c008'>It is customary to advise that a shilling should be made to go as
far as it possibly can; but surely this would be to throw a shilling
away, by making it go so far as to prevent any chance of its coming
back again.</p>

<p class='c000'>A penny saved is said to be twopence earned; so that if you have
twopence and save a penny, you have twopence still; and if the
twopence be saved till the next day, it will be fourpence; so that at
the end of the week it will amount altogether to ten shillings and
eightpence. We recommend all very young beginners to try the
experiment by putting a penny away to-day, when, if the proverb
holds good, it will have become twopence by to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c000'>"A pin a day is a groat a year;" and it will be advisable if any
one doubts the fact, to go and offer three hundred and sixty-five pins
at any respectable savings' bank—when, if the proverb be literally
true, he will be credited to the amount of fourpence.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Never put off till to-morrow what you can do to-day;" and,
therefore, if you mean to do a creditor, it is better not to put him
off, but to tell him honestly that you have put him down among
the things to be done immediately.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>HINTS TO EMIGRANTS.</h3>

<p class='c008'>A dealer in pencils should not go to Pencil-vain-here; nor would
a man stand a better chance at Botany Bay because he might have
a knowledge of botany.</p>

<p class='c000'>To very hot climates, where there is no glass in the windows, it
would be madness in the glazier to take the panes to emigrate.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>WINE <em>VERSUS</em> WATER.<br /> GREAT ANTI-TEMPERANCE MEETING.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>A highly respectable meeting of some of the most influential
Wines, Beers, and Spirits, was held for the purpose of considering
the best means of opposing the Temperance Movement. Among
those on the platform we particularly noticed Port, Sherry, and
Claret; while at the lower end of the room were Cape, Marsala,
and a deputation from the British Wines, who were represented by
the Two-and-Twopenny Sparkling Champagne, more familiarly
known as the "Genuine Walker." Most of the principal wines
wore the silver collars of the orders to which they respectively
belonged; and Port having been unanimously voted into the chair,
the business of the meeting was opened by Corkscrew, in a concise
but pointed manner.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Champagne</span> was the first to rise, in a state of great effervescence.
He declared that he was frothing over with pure indignation at
the idea of wine being excluded from the social board; and, indeed,
he found it impossible to preserve the coolness which ought to
belong to him. He was not one to keep anything long bottled up—(<em>"Hear,"
and a laugh</em>);—indeed, when he once let loose, out it
must all come: and he did say that the temperance movement
was playing Old Gooseberry with him in every direction.—(<em>Cries
of "Shame!" from the Genuine Walker.</em>)</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Claret</span> said that he did not often get into a state of fermentation;
but on this occasion he did feel his natural smoothness forsaking
him. He begged leave to propose the following resolution:—"That
the substitution of water for wine is likely to dissolve all
social ties, and is calculated to do material injury to the constitution."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Rum</span> rose, he said, for the purpose of opposing this resolution,
which he thought of too sweeping a character. He (Rum), so far
from wishing to get rid of water altogether, was always happy to
meet with it on equal terms; and he knew that he (Rum), as well
as many of his friends around him, had derived a good deal of
their influence from being mixed up with water, and going, as it
were, half-way; which there could be no objection to.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Gin</span> begged leave to differ from the honourable spirit that had
just sat down, and who was so unaccustomed to be on his legs at
all, that it was not surprising he should have failed to make a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>respectable stand on the present occasion.—(<em>Cries of "Order!"</em>)—He
(Gin) had no wish to create confusion.—(<em>Ironical cheering from
Marsala.</em>)—He understood the meaning of that cheer; and would
certainly confess that the honourable beverage—for he would not
use the stronger term of wine—(<em>A laugh</em>)—was not likely to create
confusion in any quarter. No; he (the honourable beverage) was
not strong enough for that.—(<em>Renewed laughter.</em>)—He (Gin) had,
perhaps, suffered more from water than all the other wines and
spirits whom he now saw before him put together. His reputation
had been materially hurt by it; and he was strongly of
opinion that the only thing to be done with water is to throw it
overboard.—(<em>Hear, hear.</em>)</p>

<p class='c000'>A French Wine, whose name we could not learn, let something
drop, but we were unable to catch it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Cape</span> now rose, but was immediately coughed down in a very
unceremonious manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>The thanks of the meeting having been voted to Port for his
able conduct in the decanter, the meeting separated; but not until
a committee had been chosen, consisting of a dozen of wine and a
gallon of beer, with power to add to their number, either by water
or otherwise.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>PREDICTIONS FOR JANUARY.</h3>

<p class='c008'>In examining the horoscope it seems to embrace a wide scope of
horrors. There will be dark days for England, which we must be
prepared for by lighting candles. After New Year's Day there
will be many broils, and Turkey will be torn to pieces by domestic
violence.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE GARDEN.</h3>

<p class='c008'>If anything is done in the garden at this time of the year,
perhaps the best thing will be to run about in it. Do not attempt
to move any of your trees, but keep your junior branches moving
as much as possible. This is the best time to take your shrub
in-doors; but it should be rum shrub, watered in moderation, and
taken at night over a cheerful fire.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>DECISIONS IN HILARY TERM.</h3>

<p class='c008'>The property in a lodger's possession may be seized for rent due
from a tenant, but it does not appear that the lodger's self-possession
can legally be taken away from him.</p>

<p class='c000'>A flaw in a lease will not always let in the heir, but the air is
frequently let in by a flaw in the building.</p>

<p class='c000'>When a conveyance has already sufficient parties, it has been
held that the remainder man may be shut out. This was decided in
the cases of Podger <em>versus</em> the driver and conductor of the Atlas
Omnibus.</p>

<p class='c000'>If a party offers to pledge himself, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">semble</span></i>, that a pawnbroker
cannot be compelled to take him in, though it is done frequently.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not yet decided whether the new Act for the Protection of
the Queen's Person, which inflicts a penalty for presenting fire-arms
at the Queen's person, does or does not extend to the sentinels on
duty, who present arms at Her Majesty whenever she leaves the
Palace.</p>

<p class='c000'>The New Poor Law Act, prohibiting all out-door relief, does not
apply to trees, which may be re-leaved out of doors at the usual
period.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a question whether, by the recent law, which says that all
children under five are to be carried gratuitously in any stage-carriage,
a mother may insist on claiming free passage for four children
by any public conveyance.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been decided that the Act giving the net proceeds of a
slave ship to the captors, does not mean that they are only entitled
to the fish caught in nets on board the vessel.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Court of Queen's Bench has declared, that a minor under the
age of ten years cannot legally be a miner since the passing of the
Mines and Collieries' Regulation Act.</p>

<p class='c008'>The depth of rain may be ascertained by placing a common stick
in an ordinary puddle; or, to walk into one will answer the same
purpose. If there should be ice in your water-jug, Moore says,
"Look for its continuance;" but we say, "Look for something to
break it, and put an end to it." If there is much fog, it will be
useless to look for anything.</p>

Street.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE WEATHER.</h3>

<p class='c008'>The character of the weather is rather violent at this time of the

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>REPORT ON<br /> THE TRAINING OF PAUPER CHILDREN.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In turning our attention to the infant mind, we have discovered that
it is a sort of compound of caoutchouc and wax, the caoutchouc being
to the wax about two and a-half to one and three-quarters; so that
more whacks will be found requisite to give it a proper tone for educational
purposes. There is no doubt that children, like grape-vines,
prizefighters, scarlet-runners, and jockeys, are capable of training.
The mode of training jockeys, which is to keep them on short diet, so
as to diminish their weight, we strongly recommend for the training
of pauper children; because, as they are necessarily a burden to the
parish, it is only fair that they should be as light a burden as
possible.</p>

<p class='c000'>The introduction of Mr. Hullah's system of Singing for the Million
we do not recommend. It increases the appetite by exercising the
lungs; and it has been ascertained that if thirty children are taken,
of whom fifteen have just sung God Save the Queen, and fifteen have
not, the fifteen who have sung God Save the Queen will eat one-sixteenth
more than the fifteen others. This was tried with a round
of beef and some boys belonging to the Model School at Battersea.
The beef, when divided by those who had not been singing, went
once into fifteen and something over; but the boys who had been
singing went twice into the beef, and left the remainder nothing.</p>

<p class='c000'>With regard to dancing, we are inclined to believe that it may
safely be made a portion of the training of pauper children. It would
certainly give facility to their future steps in life, and enable them
to turn themselves round after they leave the workhouse. We are
also disposed to think that the great demand for cherubs, which is
likely to arise by the opening of the large theatres for opera and
ballet, will render the "dancing of pauper children" an important
source of parochial revenue. With a view to the introduction of
dancing into pauper schools, we have caused a copy of the following
questions to be addressed to the master of every union workhouse:—</p>

<p class='c000'>"1. Inquire the state of all the pauper children's toes, and how
they are likely to turn out.</p>

<p class='c000'>"3. Inquire the age at which the dancing days are usually said
to be over.</p>

<p class='c000'>"4. Cause an investigation into the meaning of the familiar term
'leading him a pretty dance;' which is believed to be a sort of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pas
de do</span></i> between a debtor, who is out of the way, and a creditor.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>"2. Ascertain the number of bow-knees and bandy-legs throughout
the school, and divide them into tables, distinguishing the ages of
the respective owners."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Commissioners have little doubt that dancing was originally
taught in our colleges; and they think they need only point to the
College Hornpipe as a proof of their hypothesis. Sir Christopher
Hatton, whose dancing attracted the attention of Queen Elizabeth,
probably imbibed his knowledge of the art from one of our great
seats of learning; and the Commissioners think it very natural
that a good dancer should be capable of filling the first position. It
is not unlikely that he was selected to fill the office of Lord Chancellor
from his proficiency in the double-shuffle, or from his knowing
when to change sides, turn round, and go back to places.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is to the Commissioners a most refreshing fact that one experiment
they have made of a charity ball has been attended with
complete success; for a lesson in mathematics is found to combine
with a lesson in dancing. The pupils were observed to describe very
accurately with their legs a series of the most difficult angles,
which they had often very vainly attempted to achieve by the aid of
the compasses.</p>

<p class='c000'>In conclusion, the Commissioners strongly recommend that the
masters of workhouses should be instructed to take the proper steps
for introducing the art of dancing, as a portion of the future training
of pauper children.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>PREDICTIONS FOR MARCH.</h3>

<p class='c008'>About the twenty-fifth tenants may look for their landlords; but
landlords will, some of them, look in vain for their tenants.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>GARDENING OPERATIONS.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Now is the time to force your cucumbers; but if they will not
come by being forced, try what can be done by persuasion. All
your efforts will be useless if the cucumbers themselves are not in
the right frame.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>OBSERVATIONS.</h3>

<p class='c008'>The prevalence of the wind is so great in the month of March
that the trees generally begin blowing.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sun will certainly enter Aries on the 19th; which is perhaps
a reason for pulling down the kitchen-blinds; but this is optional.</p>

may act as sleepers.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the peculiar advantages of the Electro-Intellecto-Mesmeric
Railroad consists in there being no occasion for steam, the power of
raising the wind by the most active and continued puffing being
considered sufficient to carry all matters to the terminus of popularity.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are already two or three engines in the possession of the
projectors, one of which is the Humbug Locomotive, of very considerable
power.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is intended to celebrate the opening of the line by a grand march
of intellect; Lord Brougham and the projector of the Aerial Ship
have both promised to attend. The latter will refute the assertion
as to the Aerial Ship having been thrown up; for, instead of being
thrown up, it has never been elevated in the smallest degree, nor is
such an event at all likely to happen.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>AN ESSAY ON RENT.<br /> BY A POLITICAL ECONOMIST.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Rent is the price of land; but there is some rent that is not the
price of land: for instance, it must be said of the Repeal Rent,
that there is no real ground for it.</p>

<p class='c000'>An English acre will sometimes yield six per cent.; but the Irish
wiseacres have been known to yield much more. It must, however,
be remembered that in the latter case draining has been
carried to the greatest extent possible.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rents in England go up when the country is settled; but in
Ireland it is quite the reverse: for the Repeal Rent rises when the
people are worked up, and it is then they appear willing to come
down with it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The profit of a landlord and the profit of a shopkeeper partake
equally of the character of rent. The former lives by tilling his
land, and the latter by putting into a till (which is the same thing
as tilling) his money.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is an obvious truth in political economy that the more rent a
tenant has to pay, the more a landlord will have to receive, and
the better it will be for him. Thus, if a tenant pays no rent for a
whole year, more rent will be due, and the value of the property
would seem to be increased; at all events, the landlord's claim
would be a larger one than if the rent had been regularly paid
every quarter.</p>

<p class='c000'>If a farmer pays five pounds a quarter for his farm, and gets
twenty shillings a quarter for his corn, he may consider the difference
between the maximum of one and the minimum of the other
as the mean product.</p>

<p class='c000'>The landlord and the tenant equally profit by consumption: for
the more that is consumed, the greater the value of what is left.
Thus, if a fire consumes a haystack, or consumption of a galloping
nature carries off a horse, the owner would, according to political
economists, be all the richer for it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Capital and labour belong legitimately to the subject of rent.
The greatest labour is sometimes employed in raising capital; as
in the case of the labour bestowed on raising the capital for the
statue of the Nelson column. Labour is often intimately connected
with rent, for in some neighbourhoods there is a vast deal
of labour in collecting it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quarter-day is the day when rent comes due. But, when due, it
does not always come; and a landlord who expects his rent
punctually at the quarter is too sanguine by half.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>PROSPECTUS OF<br /> THE AERIAL BUILDING COMPANY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>A few gentlemen having taken the air for the purposes of building,
have formed themselves into a Company, and are anxious to
let in a limited number of the public. A surveyor, employed to
survey the air, has reported that he sees nothing to obstruct the
views of the Company. It is one of the peculiar advantages of this
Association that there need be no outlay for land; and the great
hope of success in this speculation arises from the fact that there
is no ground for it. The Company will apply to Parliament for an
Air-Enclosure Bill, on the same principle as the proposed measure
for shutting up Hampstead Heath; but, in the meantime, the
treasurer will receive deposits on shares, and take premiums for
air allotments. The intention of the Company is to form an Aerial
City; and an architect has drawn plans, including sites for the
various contemplated buildings, the whole of which buildings may
be seen (on paper) at the Society's office, so that the sites may be
at once secured and paid for.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Company, not desiring to express any opinion as to the
various contrivances for navigating the air proposed within the last
few years, will leave it to the public to decide which principle it will
be best to adopt, the Company declining to have anything to do
with any principle whatever.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Company, it must be understood, will convey the air under
hand and seal; but the purchaser will have to convey the building.
It is a desirable point in this speculation that there will be no tax
for paving or lighting, there being no charge made by the Trustees
of the Milky Way, nor is there any star-rate payable.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is suggested that much may be done by parties willing to
speculate in the air, when they are once comfortably settled there.
Though it is true that the experiment of procuring sunbeams from
cucumbers was never successfully carried out, the Aerial Building
Company would hint the possibility of reversing this project, by
getting cucumbers from sunbeams.</p>

<p class='c000'>Further particulars may be had at the office in Air Street, where
any questions may be asked; but, to save trouble, no answers will
be given to any but <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonâ fide</span></i> shareholders.—There are vacancies
for a few clerks, who, on taking shares to the amount of £500, will
receive 30s. a week for their services while the Company lasts, in
addition to the usual dividend.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE WEATHER.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Hail now commences its reign. If the Surrey Zoological Gardens
should open, expect a flow of showers, particularly if the announcements
should name a day for a show of flowers.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>FARMING OPERATIONS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Sow acorns in pots, with a view to future timber; and plant out
young oaks in mignonette boxes. Sell off your pork, if you have
any on hand; and, if you have a live pig, it will be better to go
the whole hog and get rid of it at once, for the sale becomes doubtful
as the summer advances.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>PROVINCIAL THEATRICALS.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Doublethrust, who had long occupied the honourable position
of second cut-throat on the national boards, finding that the
managers had taken to cutting each others' throats, and consequently
left nothing for him to do, got together a select company
for the purpose of performing Shakspeare in the provinces. Having
arrived at a small village in the north, he became lessee of a
barn, and advertised to open it "on the principle of the national
theatres," the latter having been frequently conducted in a style
worthy of the former, so that there was nothing really new in the
combination. The season was announced to commence with</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The barn was crowded; and the leading family in the village occupied
the threshing machine, which was fitted up as a private box.
The national anthem was played on a bird organ, the whole company
standing; immediately after which Mr. Doublethrust spoke
the Address, from which we give an extract:—</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>The</span> cheering here was tremendous, there being in the
village three young men with the names mentioned,
each having high pretensions to literary distinction.
The Jonesites were vehement in their applause; but the Tomkinsonians
were not to be outdone; and the Smithians being thus
worked up to an enthusiastic pitch of excitement, it was some time
before Mr. Doublethrust could proceed with the address he was
speaking. The following were the concluding lines, which elicited
the most rapturous shrieks ever heard within an English barn,
or indeed beneath a British weathercock:—</p>

<p class='c000'>The play of "Macbeth," <em>from</em> the text of Shakspeare, now proceeded,
and the manager's candour in using the disjunctive <em>from</em> was
speedily visible. The ambitious thane wore a plaid shawl, commonly
called a horse-cloth, and a pair of stocking-drawers, with a
breast-plate formed of the brass ornaments used to cover the screws
of tent bedsteads. The scene with the witches was thrown into
such confusion by the performers not knowing their parts, that it
was impossible to say which was witch, and, by way of an overflow
at half-price, the rain came on in such torrents at about half-past
eight, that in the fourth act Macbeth came on under an umbrella,
beneath the shelter of which he concluded the performance. The
damp thus thrown on the efforts of the new lessee brought the
season to a precipitate close, and Doublethrust abdicated the
managerial throne after a short rain, but by no means a merry one.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE PRIZE CARTOONS.</h3>

<p class='c008'>The late competition for Cartoons must cause some alteration in
the next edition of Johnson's Dictionary; for what is meant by the
word Cartoon will require considerable explanation, after the very
extraordinary collection recently exhibited at Westminster. According
to some of the artists, Cartoon signifies anything brought
in a cart; for such is the only claim to be called a Cartoon that
many of the specimens can pretend to. Chalking walls used formerly
to be a very profitable employment; and we have often
thought what could have become of the wall-chalkers since the
blacking-makers ceased to have their Day—and Martin. These
artists of a menial capacity (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vide</span></i> the Latin Dictionary for the
meaning of <em>mœnial</em>) came out in considerable strength at the late
exhibition of Cartoons, and they have chalked up a pretty long
account against themselves on the walls of Westminster. That the
exhibition was put an end to rather summarily at the beginning of
autumn, we are not surprised; it is only astonishing that they were
not made to "walk their chalks" at a much earlier period.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Commissioners of the fine arts shot at a pigeon, and killed a
crow. They wished to ascertain the state of the art of historical
painting, and got a glorious collection of designs for burlesquing
British history, showing at once the palmy state to which the art
of caricature has risen in this country. Fauns have been satirized,
and the British lion has been made in the mane a very humorous-looking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>animal. As to Magna Carta, never did it give rise to
such tremendous liberties as the drawers of the Cartoons have
taken with it. Shakspeare is fortunately immortal, or his fame
could scarcely have escaped the violent hands that have been laid
upon him. Macbeth and the Witches are so beautifully confused
that it is difficult to say which is Macbeth and which the Witches.
There is the murder of Duncan, with his two sons in the distance,
looking on as calmly as if they were indeed very distant relatives.
There is the Ghost of Cæsar appearing to Brutus; but the artist,
not knowing how to treat light and shade, has caricatured the
shade most miserably. Some have selected Shakspeare upon Mercy
for illustration, but without having any mercy upon Shakspeare;
and somebody has favoured us with Drake on the quarter-deck,
Drake being distinguished by a pair of ducks,—a touch of humour
we could not fail to appreciate. Most of the artists seemed to have
laboured under an awful enlargement of the imagination, which set
them off commencing their drawings upon an enormous scale, obliging
them to moderate their conceptions before the completion of the
picture. The fact that there was many a Cartoon which would
have gone in, but that there was no getting it through the door,
illustrates this malady among the artists. It may be considered as
a species of Elephantiasis, inducing the idea that one's self and
one's subject are much more vast than they are in reality. It would
seem that some of the artists have misread the advertisement of
the Commissioners of Fine Arts, and that for the word "decorate"
some of them read "desecrate" the walls of Parliament.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>REPORT OF<br /> THE ROYAL HUMANE SOCIETY<br /> FOR THE PREVENTION OF ACCIDENTS ON ARTIFICIAL ICE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>This Society has been established for the Prevention of Accidents
on Artificial Ice, and is happy to refer the public to the following</p>

<h4 class='c017'>CASE.</h4>

<p class='c008'>A gentleman was skating in a first floor, and had been several
times warned by artificial ice-man Snooks not to pass over a certain
spot, for it was known there was a large chandelier immediately
beneath, the great heat from which, by thawing the artificial ice,
might render it dangerous. The gentleman, however, persisted;
when, following the usual course, the Humane Society caused ropes
to be thrown across from side to side, which might at all events catch
the skates, if not check the boldness of the skaters. Luckily, the precaution
took effect, tripping the gentleman up, and breaking his
fall; when another artificial ice-man, seeing the danger, resorted to
the customary experiment of placing a ladder immediately over the
hole into which the skater had been plunged. This course is always
adopted on natural ice; for, as a person before drowning is supposed
to rise three times, it is desirable to prolong his chance by preventing
him from rising at all—even for the first time—as long as possible.
Unfortunately, there was no boathook at hand—an instrument
found so useful in cases of accident on natural ice, or it is probable
that the individual might have been fished up with the greatest
facility. The gentleman was now immersed in mortar, and, hanging
on by a rafter, presented a complete case of suspended animation
for several minutes. Artificial ice-man Snooks immediately plunged
in among the laths, while the plaster cracked and gave way at
every step he took, in the most frightful manner. He had previously
made fast a rope to a hook in the ceiling above, and the unfortunate
individual, who clung to his preserver, was thus extracted from his
perilous position. The usual remedies were promptly resorted to.
He was held up for several minutes by the heels, to allow the dust
and plaster to escape from his mouth, and was then taken to the
receiving-house, where brandy-and-water were administered in such
copious draughts, and with such excellent effect, that he soon lost
all sense of the accident.</p>

<p>A NEW ART-IF-ICE—Doubly Hazardous.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>The Society would earnestly recommend the following precautions
to all who are in the habit of resorting to the artificial ice:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Always select, if possible, a ground floor; and, indeed, from the
specimens of skating exhibited every day by the horses, it would
seem that the wooden pavement is better adapted than anything
else to the purpose of glaciarium. When you feel yourself going
into a hole, throw yourself on your back, when the artificial ice-man
will probably dash a ladder on to your face; and if you can
contrive to get your head through the rounds of the ladder, you are
drawn up easily.</p>

<p class='c000'>Never venture where you see a board with the word "Dangerous."
You may be sure that the Society's men are aware of a hole, which,
as they have made it themselves by sticking up the board, they can
have made no mistake about.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Humane Society, fully aware of the efficacy of brandy in
cases of suspended animation, caused an analysis to be made of the
brandy-balls usually sold upon the ice, when the following result
was obtained:—</p>

<table class='table1' summary=''>

<p class='c000'>On the whole, the Society would not feel justified in recommending
it as a stimulant.</p>

To artificial ice-man Brown, for plunging into a parlour, where a
gentleman had fallen on to a tea-table, and rescuing him from a
boiling watery grave, the small silver medal, with a portrait of the
Queen on one side, and the words "<span class='fss'>SIX PENCE</span>," in raised letters, on
the other. The thanks of the Society, on comic note-paper, were
also given to the tradesman who had supplied (on credit) the whole
of the apparatus.</p>

<p>Guy Fawkes treated Classically—An Unexhibited Cartoon</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>THE UNEXHIBITED CARTOON OF GUY FAWKES.<br /> BY GEORGE CRUIKSHANK.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Having been advised by my friends to publish a sketch of my
cartoon, intended for exhibition at Westminster Hall, I think the
public, upon seeing it, will require some explanation of it. The
subject has often been treated, and sometimes rather ill-treated, by
preceding artists. Being forcibly struck by the grand classical
style, I have aimed at it, and I trust I have succeeded in hitting it.
At all events, if I have not quite come up to the mark, I have had
a good bold fling at it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first thing I thought it necessary to think of (though, by-the-bye,
it is generally the last thing thought of in historical
painting), was to get a faithful portrait of the principal character.
For that purpose I determined to study nature, and strolled about
London and the suburbs on the 5th of November, in search of a
likeness of Fawkes, caring little under what Guys it might be presented
to me. Unfortunately, some had long noses and some had
short; so, putting this and that together, the long and the short
of it is, that I determined on adopting a living prototype, who has
been blowing up both Houses of Parliament for several years, and
if not a Fawkes in other respects, is at least famous for encouraging
forking out on the part of others.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having got over the preliminary difficulty, I set to work upon
my cartoon: and being resolved to make it a greater work than had
ever before been known, I forgot the prescribed size, for my head
was far above the consideration of mere feet, and I did not reflect,
that where Parliament had given an inch I was taking an ell, at the
very lowest estimate. Having strolled towards Westminster Hall
to survey the scene of my future triumphs, it struck me that I had
carried the grand classical to such a height as to preclude all chance
of my cartoon being got in through the doorway: and I, therefore,
with the promptitude of a Richard the Third, determined to "Off
with his head," by taking a slice off the top of the canvass. This
necessary piece of execution rather spoiled the design, but it enabled
me to throw a heaviness into the brows of my principal figure,
which, if it marred the resemblance to Fawkes, gave him an additional
look of the Guy, at all events. It then occurred to me that I
might further diminish the dimensions by taking a couple of feet
off the legs; and this happy idea enabled me to carry out the historical
notion that Fawkes was the mere tool of others, in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>case, to cramp him in the understanding must be considered a nice
blending of the false in art with the true in nature. The Guy's
feet were accordingly foreshortened, till I left him, as he appeared
when trying to defend himself at his trial, with hardly a leg to
stand upon. Besides I knew I could fresco out his calves in fine
style, when I once got permission to turn the fruit of my labours
into wall-fruit, on the inside of the Houses of Parliament.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will now be naturally asked, why my cartoon was not exhibited
with others, some of each were equally monstrous, in the Hall of
Westminster. The fact is, if the truth must out, the cartoon would
not go in. Though I had cramped my genius already to suit the
views of the Commissioners, and the size of the door, I found I
must have stooped much lower if I had resolved on finding admittance
for my work. I wrote at once to the Woods and Forests,
calling upon them to widen the door for genius, by taking down a
portion of the wall: but it will hardly be believed, that though
there were, at the time, plenty of workmen about the building, no
answer was returned to my request. Alas! it is all very well to
sing, as they do in Der Frieschutz, "Through the Woods and
through the Forests," but towards me the Woods and Forests
proved themselves utterly impenetrable.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will be seen that the arch conspirator—for so I must continue
to call him, though he could not be got into the archway—has
placed his hat upon the ground, a little point in which I have
blended imagination with history, and both with convenience. The
imagination suggests that such a villain ought not to wear his hat;
history does not say that he did, which is as much as to hint that
he didn't; while convenience coming to the aid of both, renders it
necessary for his hat to lie upon the ground, for if I had tried to
place it on his head, there would have been no room for it. There
was one gratifying circumstance connected with this cartoon which,
in spite of my being charged with vanity, I must repeat. As it
was carried through the streets it seemed to be generally understood
and appreciated, every one, even children, exclaiming as it
passed, "Oh! there's a Guy!"</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE FEAST OF THE GROTTOES.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Surely the antiquity of oysters cannot be doubted; but there is
some reason to believe that grottoes are of a more recent origin.
There is a grotto of the Cumæan Sybil at Naples; but it does not
seem to have been constructed of oyster-shells—though its position
near the sea would indicate that shells of some kind were probably
used in its construction.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first oyster ever introduced into this country was probably
brought over by Sir Walter Raleigh; who, as he imported cigars,
potatoes, and saltpetre, may, probably, have met with oysters in
his celebrated journey round the world, and carried over a barrel
with him on his return to England; which would surely have been
quite as reasonable a piece of luggage as a barrel of gunpowder.
This theory is further supported by the well-known proverb, that
"he must have been a bold man who first ate an oyster;" and as
the courage of Raleigh was never doubted, we may fix upon him
with some degree of confidence as the first oyster-eater that this
country can boast of. But valour of this kind was never so eminently
displayed as in the comparatively recent instance of Dando,
who, to the courage of eating oysters to an unlimited extent, added
the far greater boldness of declining to pay for them. Dando was,
however, "native, and to the manner born" for it. To return to
the subject of grottoes: the annual grotto feast is observed by the
children of the humbler classes, who, with infantine simplicity,
insist on declaring that it is "only once a year" for several days in
succession. There is a remnant of feudalism in the mode adopted
by some of the bigger boys to obtain possession of the grottoes
constructed by weaker children. The former descend in rude and
barbarous hordes, beating off the original possessors, and exacting
custom from the surrounding neighbourhood. This is in strict
conformity with the law of primogeniture; for the elder boys
generally "take," as the lawyers say, to the exclusion of the
younger.</p>

seems that a state of bobbishness is one of vulgar
health, and that the less genteel neighbourhoods,
under the most favourable circumstances, are
greatly conducive to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Water is one of the first essentials to health, and, consequently,
a rainy day ought to be a source of great salubrity.
It is also a principal ingredient in the diet of
paupers, no doubt on account of its sanatory properties.
Water, in conjunction with ventilation, may be regarded
as the safety-valve of disease; so that a walk in a pelting
shower, with a hole or two in the hat and boots, ought to
be prescribed as a preventive against the chance of
illness.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>TREATING WITH CHINA.<br /> DESPATCH FROM SIR HENRY POTTINGER.</h3>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Taking</span> advantage of my full powers to treat, I asked
the Commissioner what he would like me to treat him to. He at
first suggested beer; but from what I have seen of the Chinese, I
fancied that they stood more in need of spirit than anything else;
and as my instructions were to mix as much as possible with the
Imperial authorities, I kept mixing brandy and water till past
midnight, in company with Key-sing, who did ample justice to the
grog that was placed before him. The effect of the liquor was
such as to cause me to receive several friendly assurances in broken
Chinese; and the Commissioner, I am sure, soon began to see
doubly all the advantages I was endeavouring to point out to him.
In a short time such was the spirit of harmony inspired by the
grog, that a song was volunteered by Key-sing; but it is impossible
to say what key Key-sing did sing it in. I was then called
upon to favour them with a vocal effort; and as my instructions
were to meet the wishes of the Chinese government as well as I
could, I struck up, "Home, sweet home," a selection which, I trust,
will meet the approbation of the Home Office. The treaty had not
yet received the signature of Key-sing; and he seemed to be
wavering,—leaning first on one side, and then on the other; but at
length he fell with his face flat upon the treaty, which I believe
was intended to show his great respect for it. Such was his emotion,
that he was with difficulty raised; and his hand was at length
guided by a mandarin, who had partaken less freely of the grog
than the Chief Commissioner. Key-sing then left for his own
abode, singing and dancing all the way home, and addressing every
one he met, to whom he was, probably, explaining the advantages
that China will derive from the happy union.</p>

    <div>(<em>By the Foreign Correspondent of the "Comic Almanack."</em>)</div>

<p class='c000'>The Spanish are, as you know, very nutty on their late revolution.
Several provinces have pronounced; but as they all have a peculiar
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">patois</span></i> of their own, it is difficult to catch their pronunciations.
America is in a more settled, though certainly not in a more
settling, state than it was some time ago. It has resorted freely to
the old way of paying new debts, and in return for our specie, has
sent us a species of whitewash, which is all that we can get as an
equivalent. It is a glorious thing to see a whole nation throwing
off its bonds; and the way in which America has released herself
from the bonds she was under to her creditors, is a proof that she
knows how to be free herself, and to make free with others. On the
other side of the Channel, Young France finding it impossible to
beard Old England, has taken to bearding itself; and the war-party
show, by their chins at any rate, that they would be much improved
by a good lathering. New South Wales, as you are by this time
aware, is to have a representative assembly; but it is not yet decided
what the legislative body is to consist of. It would perhaps
be the fairest plan, that each of the prisons should send so many
members to the Botany Bay parliament; but others think that each
class of offenders should have its own representatives. Whether
the Honourable Member for Newgate would sound better than the
Gallant Representative of the Housebreaking Interests, is a question
that may be decided hereafter; and it will be a very nice point,
whether conviction shall be a necessary qualification for a seat in
the legislature of New South Wales, or, whether the fact of having
committed an offence, shall render a person eligible as a candidate.
It will perhaps be difficult to draw the line where the elective franchise
shall begin, but it is generally believed, that nothing under a
pickpocket ought to be entitled to vote, though, whether the claimant
to the suffrage must have been positively caught in the act, is
a nicety on which I leave it to the lawyers to deliberate.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>OBSERVATIONS OF A NATURALIST.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The average quantity of vapour from below is always greater
after a public meeting, at which patriotic speeches have been made.</p>

<p class='c000'>As we advance towards the Pole, the wind rises; and, by a remarkable
coincidence, it is easy for an elector to raise the wind as
the day for going to the poll approaches.</p>

<p class='c000'>In warm weather the dissolving power is greater; and the summer
is generally chosen for dissolving Parliament.</p>

<p class='c000'>Moisture ascending, forms clouds; and liquor which gets into the
head causes a mist over the eyes; a fact that shows the analogy
existing between all the operations of nature.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bishop Berkeley has observed, that there are more levels in
England than are generally to be found elsewhere. This notion
accounts for the Bishop having published many things, in which he
treated England as a country of flats.</p>

<p class='c000'>About the 4th or 5th of February, it has been observed that the
woodlark renews his note. Birds of passage do not always renew
their notes on the 4th, but dishonour their bills very frequently.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been remarked, that in September evenings the reduction
of temperature begins to be sensibly felt by those who expose themselves
to it thinly clad. We cannot concur in the general observation
that it is sensibly felt, for the more sensible thing would be to
wrap oneself well up, and avoid altogether feeling it.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was generally observed, that the summer of 1843 was one of
the finest that has been known for many years. This may be
easily accounted for by the non-opening of Vauxhall Gardens.
Preparations had been made for the commencement of the season,
and there was a week of incessant rain; but the idea being abandoned,
the weather became fine, and continued so for the remainder
of the summer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Saturn is generally allowed to be a very inclement planet; and
it may be seen directly over Clement's Inn during a portion of the
year.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>SIX RICHARDS IN THE FIELD.<br /> A NEW ACTING SHAKSPEARE.</h3>

<p class='c008'>It is quite evident that Shakspeare, in its present state, is not suited
to the capacity of the existing race of tragic actors. On the same
principle that somebody is said to have gone to bed because the bed
would not go to somebody, it seems advisable to bring Shakspeare
down to the actors because the actors can't come up to Shakspeare.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was once suggested that the play of "Hamlet," with the character
of Hamlet omitted, might probably lose some of its effect
in dramatic representation. If this theory is a good one, it follows,
as a matter of course, that the play of "Richard the Third," with
six Richards instead of one, must be six times as good as it is with
only a single embodiment of that extraordinary character. That
this is the opinion of modern tragedians is shown by their all requiring
to perform the principal part in all tragedies: an arrangement
that could only be carried out by multiplying the chief character
in a piece by the number of individuals in a theatre who want
to act it. Whether the negative capacities of three or four individual
performers can make an affirmative capacity, is an experiment
that might be tried, at all events. "Division of labour" is a
very favourite project amongst speculators in the present day; and
if Messrs. A., P., and V., are separately unequal to the effort of
sustaining the weight of the crook-backed tyrant, why should not
the tyrant be cut into three—some actors, by-the-bye, cut him all
to pieces—so that each of the performers hinted at might bear a
portion of the burden? Mr. A. might do the love scene with Lady
Anne; Mr. P. might growl through the opening soliloquy; and Mr.
V. might go to sleep throughout the dream: an achievement which
the drowsiness of his style renders him fully equal to.</p>

<p class='c000'>That the bard of Avon contemplated the possibility of something
of the kind is shown by the expression he puts into the mouth of
Richard himself, who, in making the well-known exclamation,</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>"Methinks I see six Richmonds in the field,"</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>may be supposed to have hinted at the possibility of there being
six competitors for his own position—that of hero of the tragedy.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span><span class='sc'>In March.</span>—That the month is a stormy one at sea, causing

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In May.</span>—That, on the 14th, vaccination was first used, in 1796;
and that, while it saved many from being pitted with the smallpox,
the invention itself may be pitted against any other.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>June.</span>—That the sun is before the clock on the 7th, which may be

<h3 class='c007'>THE POLAR EXPEDITION.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Candidly speaking, a voyage to the North Pole has many
advantages. In the first place, the Polar bears are the finest in
the world for bear's grease, and it makes the hair stand on end
merely to look at them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The North Pole is generally supposed to be a sort of sign-post,
embedded in ice, in latitude 0° 0´, longitude x° x´; and it is popularly
believed that Captain Ross not only cut his name on the pole
itself, but nailed the English standard to the top of it. It has
been contemplated by some who take an interest in these matters,
to bring the North Pole to England, and place it in the Museum
as a companion to Cleopatra's needle. Whether the passage to
the North Pole will ever become a favourite with those who travel
for mere pleasure is somewhat questionable, but there is no knowing
what mercantile enterprise may do, and an expedition to
obtain bear-skin coats—particularly if undertaken by such a house
as Baring Brothers—would, if it only proved barely remunerative,
say a great deal for British enterprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is only one disadvantage attending a voyage to the Pole,
which is the difficulty of getting there, to say nothing of the
extreme improbability of getting safely back again. The forcing a
passage to the Pole is a grand achievement. And as the road is
frozen up before the expedition can return, it is always necessary
to force another passage back again. Nature certainly seems to
have written up "No Thoroughfare," and the pole itself appears
to be inscribed with the words "No admittance except on business;"
but this warning has no effect upon those enthusiasts who
are determined to rush to the Pole at any sacrifice.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>THE LEGAL ART-UNION.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Some doubt having been entertained as to the legality of Art-Unions,
it has been determined to establish a legal Art-Union, by
which the most expensive of known luxuries—law—can be dealt
out to the subscribers upon most reasonable terms. The Union is
to consist of as many persons as think proper to subscribe, and the
object will be the bringing and defending actions, so that debtors
and creditors will equally profit by it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every subscriber, on paying six-and-eightpence, will have a
declaration delivered to him if he be a debtor; or if a creditor, he
will receive a plea; and the prizes will consist of a certain number
of verdicts, to be selected from the public exhibitions of justice,
including the Courts of Request, the Lord Mayor's, and Sheriffs'
Courts. If a plaintiff draws a prize, he will get the whole of the
money; and if a debtor draws a blank, he will have to pay it; but
if the debtor and the creditor both draw blanks, they neither of
them get anything, but their loss is limited to six-and-eightpence.
If a debtor obtains a fortunate number he is exonerated from his
debt without the disgrace or inconvenience of running away; while
a creditor, even if he does not get his money, is prevented from
throwing any of the good after the bad, and thus all parties reap
advantages which they could not obtain in the regular course of
law. It is thought that the causing the verdicts to depend on
chance, and thus introducing the lottery principle into the administration
of justice, is quite in conformity with what, in nine
cases out of ten, practically happens.</p>

<p class='c000'>Prospectuses may be had at the chambers of Messrs. Drain,
Swindle, and Company, Solicitors to the Court of Portugal, and
Attorneys Extraordinary (most extraordinary!) to anyone employing
them.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>POST OFFICE REGULATIONS.</h3>

<p class='c008'>The letter-carriers are all to wear uniforms, in order to carry out
the principle of the uniform postage. All the old Twopennies are
placed on the same footing as Generals.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mails, since the reduction of the rate, are allowed to travel
slower than formerly. The Hounslow mail being carried in a cab,
and, there being no accommodation for a guard, the Government
will not be responsible for the safe conduct of the bags beyond the
Sloane Street frontier. Letters for Kingston, not intended to go by
Falmouth, should be marked Kingston-upon-Thames, or they will
be despatched to Kingston in Jamaica.</p>

<p class='c000'>Money intended to benefit the letter-carriers should be enclosed
in an envelope addressed to any friend of the writer. By
registering the letter, the liberal object will be defeated.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>CATECHISM OF POLITICS FOR THE FRENCH.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'><em>Q.</em> How do you define politics?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>A.</em> It is the science of constructing new governments; the first
step to which is the destruction of the existing one.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Q.</em> In what do we make it chiefly to consist?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>A.</em> In abusing our neighbours, and quarrelling amongst ourselves.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Q.</em> To what do we generally apply ourselves in peace?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>A.</em> In insulting the English.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Q.</em> How are we occupied in war?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>A.</em> In being beaten by the English.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Q.</em> How do we profit by war?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>A.</em> It gives us material for clap-traps on the stage.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Q.</em> How do we profit by defeat?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>A.</em> In calling it a victory.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Q.</em> How do we maintain our boast that we are the most ingenious
nation on the earth?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>A.</em> By employing the ingenuity of Englishmen in all our great

<p class='c000'>21st. The trustees of a life-boat at North Shields fined ten shillings for
bringing some clothes to shore; it being decided that such boats are not to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>be used to bring clothes to any one in possession of life, but only to prevent

<p class='c000'>7th. Lord Teynham moved in the Lords for the abrogation of the clause in

it never rose high enough to allow of the prediction being verified.</p>

<p class='c000'>12th. The Servian question settled by the Russian cabinet stipulating for

one of the light sovereigns that a proclamation had been previously
directed against.</p>

<p class='c000'>25th. The prizes of the Art-Union drawn at Drury Lane Theatre; and Her

<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>to the effect that partial insanity does not affect legal responsibility;
which settled the question whether Lord Brougham could be considered
legally responsible to the Birds, supposing they had brought an action against
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>30th. The Bill for the "Mutual Surrender of Criminals" read a second

  <h3 class='c007'>A SHORT TREATISE ON TIDES.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The tides have baffled the ingenuity of some of our greatest
philosophers, though Halley was more successful than any one else
in his attempts to get to the bottom of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>If we were disposed to go deeply into the tides, we should require
the reader to follow us through a variety of mysterious hieroglyphics,
which we are sure would be unintelligible to the majority.
Dashes, crosses, circles, and triangles would be scattered over the
perplexing page in profusion, while the only result might be, that
as 0 is to a hyphen, so would be a couple of asterisks.</p>

<p class='c000'>We, therefore, prefer leaving the study of the tides to those whose
taste for the subject would lead them to a practical acquaintance
with it, which may be picked up anywhere up or down the river.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE ECLIPSES FOR 1845.</h3>

<p class='c008'>On the 6th of May there will be an eclipse of the sun; but whose
son it is to be the almanack does not mention.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 24th of March there will be a total eclipse of the moon, only
visible in London. A rabid leader will appear in the "<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nationale</span></i>,"
and the feelings of the editor will quite run away with him, on
account of Paris being eclipsed on this occasion by <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le perfide</span></i>
London.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 30th of October there will be a total eclipse of the Horse
Guards' illuminated clock by a tremendous fog. This eclipse is
expected to give such satisfaction, that it has already been announced
for repetition on the following evening; but after the 31st
the fog will be dropt.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 13th of November there will be a partial eclipse of the sun—that
is to say, the eclipse will show its partiality by being only
visible to those in a high station, who look up to it. It will first
show itself to Primrose Hill about four seconds after eight, <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> It
will look in upon Professor Airy at the Greenwich Observatory
about five minutes after nine.</p>

<p class='c000'>There will be a number of eclipses in the political world next
year; but we do not intend to throw any light upon them. No
doubt Lord John Russell will do his best to eclipse Sir Robert Peel,
and that eccentric planet, Brougham, will strive as much as he can
to eclipse Campbell, and throw him completely into the shade.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>HOROSCOPES MADE EASY TO THE MEANEST<br /> CAPACITY</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Of course every one knows that horoscopes are divisible into twelve classes,
and that one of the twelve Signs of the Zodiac is at the head of each class.
With this information any one with the aid of the following learned treatise
will be able to cast his own nativity or that of any other person.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first sign of the Zodiac is</p>

<h4 class='c017'>LIBRA,</h4>

<p class='c008'>Which formerly belonged to a person of the name of Themis, but was taken
from her for using false weights, and hung up, as a warning to tradesmen,
among the constellations. Who at present holds them Lemprière omits to
say. The Libra are uppermost in the Zodiac from the 22nd of September to
the 21st of October; consequently, any one born during that period is put
into the scales and weighed accordingly. Churchwardens who cannot balance
their accounts, and Ramo Samees who can balance anything, are generally
born under the sign of Libra. It favours also young ladies who hear from
Joseph Ady, and are blest with a large balance at their bankers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The second on the list is</p>

<h4 class='c017'>SCORPIO,</h4>

<p class='c008'>Whose malice and sting come into play from the last-mentioned date, and
penetrate everywhere up to the 21st November.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sheriffs' officers, lawyers, stage-door keepers, and anthropophagi, are
always born under this constellation.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>SAGITTARIUS</h4>

<p class='c008'>Comes next. Old Chiron, the Nimrod of his day, dwells at this Sign of the
Zodiac. He was put in possession of it by Jupiter for having taught Achilles
how to pull the long-bow. He favours Derby sweeps and the Epping Hunt,
but his patronage cannot be of much value to the latter, as his influence is
only good from the 22nd of November to the 21st of December.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</span></i> of Sagittarius is generally fond of hunting the slipper and
shooting the moon. He is known by his carpet bag, stuffed with bricks and
straw. He sports a moustache, but never shows any tip.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fourth sign is</p>

<h4 class='c017'>CAPRICORNUS,</h4>

<p class='c008'>Who was originally Jupiter's wet-nurse. His lease of the Zodiac extends to
the 21st of January, after which he is obliged to pull in his horns.</p>

<p class='c000'>This constellation is noted for the number of stupid people who are born
under it. They believe everything they see advertised, and put their trust
in pills and Moses and Son. They are mostly called "Gents." They spend
their money in Coal-holes, and smoke a kind of cabbage called "cheroot."
They abound at promenade concerts, and on the tops of omnibuses and paddle-boxes
on Sundays.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>FLYING ARTILLERY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Capricornus, when he has finished going the Circuit of the Zodiac, is succeeded
by</p>

<h4 class='c017'>AQUARIUS,</h4>

<p class='c008'>Or the Watering-pot. Aquarius is only allowed to <em>reign</em> till the 21st of
February. The former name of this Sign was Ganymede, who was taken up
for sheep-stealing by an eagle, who was noted for being the first beak of his
day. He was carried before Jupiter, who condemned him to pour out the
nectar at a free-and-easy, of which he was chairman, in Olympus; but upon
being detected mixing the grog of the gods, who always took their liquor
neat, Ganymede was, in consequence of his foolish propensity to cold water,
sentenced to take the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sobriquet</span></i> of Aquarius, which, before the Flood, was
the Latin for Father Mathew.</p>

<p class='c000'>Aquarius is the patron Sign of Vauxhall, which he makes his residence
during the summer months. Temperance and Teetotal people are born under
his benignant favour. Doctors, too, are his children owing to their liberal
use of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aqua pompaginis</span></i>. One half of the London milk is supplied to the
metropolis by Aquarius.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>PISCES</h4>

<p class='c008'>Makes up the half-dozen of the constellations. Fish in the Zodiac, it seems,
comes into season about the 22nd of February, but will not keep after the
22nd of March. Very little is known about the private history of these
strange Pisces; they are supposed to have been a couple of John Dorys,
who, Neptune having advertised in "<em>Lloyd's List</em>" for a wife, introduced
Amphitrite, a Wapping lady, to share his oyster-bed with him. Neptune in
return, gave the Pisces the entire swim of the Zodiac, where, if Aquarius did
not brandish his watering-pot right and left about him for a month before
them, they would have nothing but currents of air and thorough drafts to
swim in. This would have made them feel very much like fishes out of
water. The Pisces look after picnics and ministerial white-bait dinners.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>ARIES</h4>

<p class='c008'>Makes his triumphal entry into the circus of the Zodiac on the 20th of March,
and keeps on the move till the 21st of April. He was the original proprietor
of the Golden Fleece, but having, from his hasty temper, got into Chancery,
he was fleeced, and then locked up for life in the Zodiac. He encourages the
breed of April fools, and looks after Chancellors and lawyers that they may
have abundance of clients.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>TAURUS</h4>

<p class='c008'>Is the prototype of John Bull, who crossed the British Channel with a pair
of corks, and, landing at Calais, carried off Europe, or Europa. Young France
has often attempted to take this bull by the horns; but, as Old Moore quaintly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>expresses it, "Y<sup>e</sup> puppyes aint yett buorn thatt can baitte y<sup>e</sup> Johnn Bull."
Taurus looks after the Spanish Legion and the Lumber Troop, and gives
them their indomitable valour. Sir Robert Peel was born under this constellation,
which accounts for his having offered his constituents at Tamworth
a Bull. Taurus superintends the bulls that are kept in the Vatican at Rome;
and all Irishmen who are born between the 22nd of April and 21st of May,
are under his influence. Taurus frequently shows himself at fairs and market-days,
when, if the weather is at all hot, he will toss any one for a cool hundred
at heads or tails.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>GEMINI</h4>

<p class='c008'>Are nine, though properly only two, in the order of Signs. Castor and Pollux
are the twins alluded to. Their berth in the constellations they received from
Jupiter, and very naturally too, as he was their father. Their mother was
Leda, a regular Spartan, but no relation to the present member for Westminster.
The saying of "What a shocking bad hat!" was first applied to
Castor. Beggarwomen, who exhibit two children on a door step, very unlike
one another, are relieved under the lucky star of the Twins. Castor and
Pollux go on very well till the 21st of June, when, as it is longest day in the
year, they generally get tired of one another's company, and do not come
together again for a twelvemonth.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>CANCER</h4>

<p class='c008'>Is a very bad Sign, indeed. It first attacked Hercules when he was attempting
to come Van Amburgh over the Hydra. Hercules did not take the
Cancer very much to heart, however; but, with one blow, packed him off to
Heaven, where, there being a place vacant at the time in the Zodiac, the
Cancer was sworn into it, and has filled it very creditably ever since. Cancer
sometimes puts the seasons out of order, by thinking he is a crab, and walking
accordingly, which is always the case when the summer is a little <em>backward</em>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>LEO</h4>

<p class='c008'>Is the next that comes upon the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tapis</span></i> of the Zodiac. It is the same Leo
whom Hercules got over in the forest of Ardennes, by means of animal magnetism,
having thrown him into a state of <em>coma</em>, with a few passes of his
club. This made the second candidate Hercules returned to the Zodiac Parliament.
England (not the Young—but the Old) was born under the protection
of the Lion, who, for this reason, is always called by orators the "British
Lion," and painted on signboards, giving his paw to the British arms, in
friendly confab with the British Unicorn. Mr. Carter, the greatest Lion
tamer since Hercules, was born during this month; and young dandies and
authors, who patronize tea-parties, are called "Lions."</p>

<h4 class='c017'>VIRGO</h4>

<p class='c008'>Comes last. She rises every year on the 22nd of August, and goes to bed, in
her golden palace of the East, on the 21st of September.</p>

shrinks abashed from vice." Ah! the picture smiles again!
The eyes beam on me—the nostrils dilate—the mouth speaks—everything

<p>SUPERIOR CRAFT—IN DOCK AND OUT OF DOCK.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 class='c007'>NOTE ON THE NAVAL FORCES OF GREAT BRITAIN.<br /> BY A FRENCH ADMIRAL.</h3>

<p class='c008'>This note is avowedly designed as a companion to the pamphlet
of the Prince de Joinville, which was intended to show how easily
England might be taken by the French; but omitted to say how
the matter might have been taken by the English. The note is
written with the same exactitude as to facts, the same knowledge of
the subject, and the same spirit of candour by which all recent
French works on England have been distinguished. We give an
abridgement of the note, which, in its original state, is extremely
full, and at the same time particularly empty.</p>

<p class='c000'>"In looking at the state of the English marine, I turned my attention
to the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">depôts</span></i> for marine stores, which of course comprise
the whole of the naval resources of perfidious Albion. To judge
of the British marine from the state of the marine stores, nothing
can be more contemptible than the former, because nothing can be
more insignificant than the latter. I asked one of the marine-store
dealers how he would provision a man-of-war with beef for a long
voyage, and he had nothing to show me but a quantity of beef
bones, which he valued at five pounds for twopence. The English
sailors, it is well known, cannot fight unless they are maddened
with grog; and I looked over the marine-store dealer's establishment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>for the exciting liquid. I looked in vain; for he had only an
enormous quantity of empty bottles, some of which he told me he
had that day been purchasing. I must do the English the justice
to say that they provide well for the dressing of the wounds of their
sailors, for the marine stores include vast heaps of linen rags, some
of which I observed were brought from persons casually coming into
the <em>depôt</em> to dispose of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Being desirous of avoiding any feeling of partiality or prejudice,
I determined not to be satisfied with a mere examination of the
stores, which must constitute the true strength of a nation's marine;
and I resolved to see her vessels afloat on the Thames, for which
purpose I made for the river. I made directly for Hungerford, one
of her richest ports, and found a considerable fleet of steamers,
several of which were manned, and at work, so that I could well
judge of their capabilities. They seemed for the most part well
officered, but there appeared a want of enthusiasm among the men;
and a great deal of quarrelling went on among the various captains,
which proves that the British navy is not in that state of union
which the English flag—the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jean d'Amitie</span></i>, or Union Jack—is
emblematical of.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Determined to give a fair trial to the merits of the British
marine, I asked of the perfidious Britons themselves which was the
best boat, and each began vociferating loudly the praises of the
vessels before me, on the deck of one of which, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'Homme pas
marié</span></i> (the <em>Bachelor</em>), I soon found myself. She had no guns with
her, and when I asked the captain where they were, he laughed in
my face, knowing, of course that the French Cabinet would submit
to any humiliation rather than undertake a war with his, the
captain of the <em>Bachelor's</em>, Government. At Chelsea, which is to
London what Havre is to us, there was a flotilla of two vessels, and
there was a great deal of small craft lying about, which as I passed
appeared to assume an insolent attitude. On leaving the vessel I
was made to produce a portion of the ship's papers, which I had
been made to hold in my possession, and pay fourpence for before
I was permitted even to embark on board the vessel. If England
still avoids a war it is not the superiority of her craft, which is
wretched enough, but it is something more than her craft—it is her
astounding cunning."</p>

<h3 class='c007'>QUARTER DAY.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>(<em>Communicated by the late Capt. Herbert Reginald De Courcy.</em>)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In some remote parts of England there exists an absurd notion,
that tenants are bound by some obsolete law to pay rent four times
a year. As I always entertained very opposite opinions on matters
of Dr. and Cr. to the mercantile portion of my fellow-creatures
(having entered the army at the early age of sixteen), I was preparing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>on the 25th of June, 18—, to avail myself of the loveliest
moonlight night that I ever witnessed, to transport the few valuables
that several years of half-pay had left me, when I was presented
with a short note from the sheriff of Middlesex, in which the worthy
functionary expressed a strong desire to avail himself of any trifles
I might possess to the amount of 48<em>l.</em> 9<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em></p>

<p class='c000'>This circumstance so utterly disgusted me with the world that I
determined to put an end to my existence, and having communicated
my intention to my wife, she not only concurred in the policy of my
determination, but expressed her willingness to assist me in its
perpetration. It was to the hands of that once-excellent woman
that I owe as respectable a death as ever terminated the chequered
life of a captain of Foot, for on the 18th of July, 18—, the following
announcement appeared in the <cite>Times</cite> newspaper, under the head of
"Deaths:"—</p>

<p class='c000'>"On the 16th ult., of decline, Captain Herbert Reginald de
Courcy, of the —— Regiment of Foot. His loss will not be easily
supplied in the <em>corps</em>, of which he was a distinguished and respected
member. He served a considerable time at Birmingham, where he
was quartered for eight months."</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day I laid aside my wig, shaved off my moustachios,
and removed a false front tooth, which I had worn since infancy,
and the metamorphosis was so complete, that having one day imprudently
ventured into the park, a tailor, to whom I was indebted
a considerable sum, actually inquired of me the way to the Colosseum.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Captain de Courcy shortly after obtained her pension as an
officer's widow, and for some years I enjoyed my ghosthood without
a single unpleasant interruption; but</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"This world is but a fleeting show,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>For man's delusion given;</div>
      <div class='line'>There's nothing certain here below"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>but death and quarter-day. About a month ago I discovered that
Mrs. Captain De Courcy had presumed upon my decease, and actually
considered herself in a state of widowhood, for ever since she
has admitted to her table a very uncomfortably good-looking fellow,
of the name of Briggs. What can I do? She defies me to interfere.
<em>I</em> am only her cousin from Yorkshire. Should I say a word, the
authorities at the War Office might object that I was "returned
killed" by a decline, and possibly be mercenary enough to deprive
me of my hard-earned pension. Again, I say, what am I to do?
As an officer and a gentleman, I ought to resent the injury. I will—I
swear it, come what may—I will throw off the mask. I will
kick Briggs, and uphold the honour of my profession, but not till
this day has passed, for this (I blush while I write it), this is
quarter-day, and I can't afford it.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>THE BLIGHTED ASH.<br /> A STORY OF A SEARED BOSOM.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It was May! the merry month of May, and bees from flower to
flower did melodiously hum, when a traveller, wrapped in an old
weather-stricken Macintosh, wound down the little hill that enters
the little village of Somerton. The old clock had just struck the
hour of sunset, and the lark retired to his nest; the screech-owl was
beginning to tune his voice for his nocturnal screeching; while the
bat, wrapped in contemplation, kept his keen eye steadily fixed on
the setting sun, which had begun to gild the highest peak of the
distant mountains. Alas! it is ever thus: man in his haughty
pride, like the mountain holding its head high above those by
which it is surrounded, only acknowledges the smile when it is too
late to take advantage of the warmth; or, to use a more homely
illustration, we cherish the ray, though we may have neglected the
meridian.</p>

<p class='c000'>By this time the stranger had reached the bottom of the hill, and
in a few minutes he was seated before a foaming tankard of ginger-beer,
and a generous plate of captain's biscuits, in the parlour of
the little hostelry of Somerton. The host of the "Blighted Ash"—such
was the name of the hostelry—was a man a little above the
middle stature, with firmly-knit knees, a pair of shoulders slightly
rounded, a forehead bronzed by repeated exposure to an autumn
sun, a capacious chest, and an upper lip with that peculiar curl
which is the sure sign of native aristocracy. The traveller eyed him
with searching interest, and the landlord returned glance for glance,
as he replenished the invigorating pot, at the desire of his customer.
At length the latter invited the former to partake of his cheer, and
the stranger having pushed the captain's biscuits towards the host
of the "Blighted Ash," both of them fell into a profound silence,
which was only disturbed by the ticking of the clock, or the loud
laugh of revelry in another room in the hostelry.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nearly an hour had elapsed, when the stranger, drawing his
chair close to that of his companion, looked steadily in his face, and
throwing off a flaxen wig, discovered a natural head of hair, in
which Rowland seemed to have combined with Oldridge, for the
hair displayed all the gloss of the Macassar, added to all the vigour
of the Balm of Columbia. It was but the work of an instant; and
in another moment the stranger was locked in the arms of the innkeeper,
while the latter murmured out "My son!" and the former
shrieked—"My father!"</p>

<hr class='c019' />

<p class='c000'>Both of them, a few days afterwards, left the "Blighted Ash,"
never to return; and many a legend did the village gossips relate,
of how the landlord of the "Blighted Ash" at last found a balm
for his seared bosom.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>A PANIC AT THE BANK.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It was the 11th of November. It had been raining since three
o'clock. A thick fog enveloped London. Horses smoked, as if in
a terrible passion with the weather; and omnibuses rolled along,
breaking for once their daily custom of stopping at every lamp-post
on the way. I had a secret presentiment something strange
would happen.</p>

<p class='c000'>St. Paul's struck one—two—three—four o'clock. I counted them
distinctly, one by one. They sounded like a death-knell. A dead
silence ensued, invaded only by the cries of "Cl'pam!" "M'l'end!"
that broke forth in fitful shouts from contending cads. I did not
feel well. I was leaning against a lamp-post at the corner of the
Bank—wet to the skin. My mind was very uneasy. I had that
day accepted a bill. I was vowing within myself never to accept
another, when a sudden noise—a fearful rush—recalled me to my
senses. I looked around, and saw a large stream of human beings
pouring, in fearful force, from the principal door of the Bank. Man
seemed leagued in enmity against man—clerk looked on fellow-clerk
with the lowering eyes of a malignant fiend. Their looks alarmed
me. Not a policeman was in sight! What should I do? Was the
Bank on fire? I had no money there, still there are moments when
we can feel for others. It was like a human river broken from its
bank, carrying ruin and terror wherever it went. Could it be a
panic? I recollected my Julia had 500<em>l.</em> standing there in the suitable
name of Smith. I dashed the drops of perspiration from my
fevered brow. I endeavoured to recollect myself. It was but one
effort. I determined, let it cost me what it would, to follow them
to the end.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were full two hundred beings. They formed one unbroken,
moving mass. They were running, as if with one will, frantically
together. Their speed was unnatural. The rain only made them
run the faster. Not an umbrella had they amongst them. At last
they reached the corner. The clerks behind ran as if for their very
lives. I was alarmed, and ran after them, the agent of some mysterious
fear. I lost sight of them for a moment. Again I saw
them—and, oh! what a scene presented itself to me! A band of at
least two hundred desperate clerks were struggling, fighting madly,
to get admission all into one omnibus. Their screams were dreadful.
One fat cashier was lying, dead or wounded, under the door-step,
bathed in mud. Another was shouting in agony, at the door, unable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>to work his way out or in. Twenty or thirty clerks were climbing,
to the imminent peril of their lives, on to the roof. At the same
time a severe engagement was taking place amongst a determined
dozen on the box, to decide by brutal force who should remain
master of the one seat. In the algebraical fraction of a minute
every place was invaded, and the omnibus rolled away before me,
like some frightful dream. How many lives were lost I cannot tell.
The subject was too painful to inquire into. I felt a degree of pity
for the pettiness of human nature, and had a strong glass of brandy-and-water.</p>

<p class='c000'>Never, as long as I live, shall I forget the 11th of November!</p>

<p class='c021'>[This phenomenon, we have been told, is not so strange as it may appear. Let the
curious reader only be present at the Bank, on the first <em>rainy</em> day, when the clock
strikes four, and he will infallibly—should there be only one omnibus in waiting—witness
the same desperate struggle for places as occurred to our German-minded
correspondent on the memorable 11th. It is a very amusing sport, we have been
told, to be a spectator (under an umbrella) of this animated clerk-race.]</p>

<p class='c008'>Your daughters now demand your serious attention. Dress and
plant them in rows for evening parties. Weed poor relations. Sift
"Debrett's Peerage" well through, and do your best to nail the oldest
branches. Lay traps for bets at races, and hoe young gentlemen
for gloves. Calculate the advantages of foreign, as compared with
English husbandry, and cultivate whichever promises to turn out
best. Remove younger daughters to the nursery, and towards the
30th transplant young sprigs to narrow beds at preparatory schools.
Cut your box at the opera, and look forward to spa watering for
the autumn. Trim your old man well, if he does not come out
handsomely: if the trimming should fail, forcing must be resorted
to. Put your frames in muslin bags, and cart away loose furniture
to the Pantechnicon. Graft slips on window-panes, labelled "To
Let," and harrow your servants with board wages. Clear out your
husband's purse, or if he is rather backward this year, transplant
him to back kitchen; and, screening yourselves from exposure, drill
policemen to say "the family have gone out of town."</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>NOTES OF A CONTINENTAL TOUR,<br /> IN THE SUMMER OF 1844.</h3>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div><span class='sc'>By Samuel Spooner, Esquire</span>,</div>
    <div class='c003'>FELLOW OF THE ROYAL HUMANE SOCIETY, &amp;c., &amp;c.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Happening to be at Ramsgate in the summer of 1844, and being
much out of spirits at the loss of 4<em>l.</em> 10<em>s.</em> in raffles, for which I had
won a card-rack—my mind, by-the-bye, has been upon the rack
ever since—I determined on availing myself of an opportunity to
visit the Continent, which the starting of an excursion boat to
Calais on the following day held out to me.</p>

<p class='c000'>I retired to my apartment at the hotel, and was soon wrapped in
the arms of Morpheus and a pair of Witney blankets, from both of
which I emerged at six, for our vessel was chartered to start precisely
at seven. Having swallowed a hasty pint of shrimps and a
rapid plate of bread and butter, washed down by a cup of tolerable
Twankay, I threw my zephyr over my arm, lashed my hat to my
button-hole by a piece of string, and flung myself on to a camp
stool near the binnacle of the packet. Our captain was a thorough
tar, with a white hat and a cotton pocket-handkerchief. He had
served (as a witness) in the action between the <em>Thunder</em> and the
<em>Bachelor</em>, off Westminster Hall, and was continually quoting the
words of Nelson to the crew who acted under him. These consisted
of a steward, a stoker, a boy, and a common sailor; the steward
steering the ship, the common sailor taking the tickets on landing,
and the boy throwing the rope to the people on the pier at the
termination of each voyage. The gallant old captain, in quoting the
exclamation of the hero of the Nile, always interpolated two words
to adapt the invigorating sentence to the exigencies of his own
craft, and was continually shouting—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>"England expects that every man (<em>and boy</em>) this day will do his duty."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>By this happy device of our captain the boy was inspired with the
same enthusiasm that animated the men, and the result was that
the captain was the idol of his little crew of mariners.</p>

<p class='c000'>We left Ramsgate with a stiff hurricane all around us, steaming up
in the teeth of the wind, and a good biting breeze it seemed to promise
us. On getting outside the harbour, we lurched up to the right,
then tumbled over to the left, and pitched heavily with the vessel's
head smack into the wave, as if, like a thirsty bird, she was dipping
down into the sea to take a deep drink of it. Several of the passengers
performed the same extraordinary manœuvre, and I threw
myself in helpless misery flat on the deck, where I continued to roll
backwards and forwards between the mast and an iron grating
which covered the part of the vessel containing the machinery. I
had little opportunity of cultivating the acquaintance of my fellow-passengers,
one or two of whom occasionally tumbled over me, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>I hoped if I ever tumbled over either of them in after life, that it
would be under more favourable auspices. The chief part of the
voyage was passed by me in a state of unconsciousness, and I was
roused from a sort of swoon by the information that we had arrived
at the mouth of Calais harbour, which there would be no possibility
of entering. After beating about for a space of time that I
subsequently ascertained was four hours, though it had appeared
to me about forty, we put back, and hopped, skipped, jumped,
toppled, sidled, ambled, pitched, tossed, and tumbled over the briny
deep—a great deal too deep for me to trust it again—into the harbour
of Ramsgate. After getting safely on shore we all began to abuse
the captain; but the jolly old tar, placing his thumb on the end of
his nose, gave a puff at his cigar, and went below to his dinner.
One of the party, a London attorney, who had come to Ramsgate
in pursuit of health and a runaway <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cognovit</span></i>, threatened the proprietors
of the packet with an action for not taking us to Calais,
according to agreement; but he had no sooner served process on
the agent than he was referred to the little words "Weather permitting,"
at the bottom of the bill announcing the intended landing
at Calais. This made all the difference in the contract, for the
words should have been "Weather or no," in order to sustain the
threatened action.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>PROSPECTUS OF THE<br /> MUTUAL PLATE PRESENTATION AND FRIENDLY<br /> TESTIMONIAL ASSOCIATION.</h3>

<p class='c008'>The principle of plate presentation has never yet been thoroughly
understood, or, at all events, it has never been completely and satisfactorily
acted on. The great advantage of obtaining credit for
public and private virtues through the medium of inscriptions on
cups and snuff-boxes cannot be too seriously or emphatically
insisted on. It is therefore proposed that a society should be
formed on the plan of the United Brothers, the Associated Sons of
Harmonious Freedom, and other similar institutions, the object of
the projectors being the presentation of testimonials in honour of
the private and public virtues of the various members.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is proposed to issue ten thousand shares of one pound each,
one shilling deposit being paid at the time of allotment. The holder
of ten shares will be entitled to a snuff-box on the death of his wife,
with an inscription eulogistic of his virtues as a "tender husband."
On the death of each child he will receive a pencil-case, with a brief
allusion to his qualities as the "best of fathers;" and on the
decease of himself, his widow will be presented with a tooth-pick in
albata, having a consolatory motto engraved on the back of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Applications for shares to be made at the offices of the Electro-Mosaic-Nickel
Continental and Birmingham Gold and Silver Establishment,

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>GOLDEN RULES FOR MENDICANTS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>1. Always carry a box of lucifers in your hand. It is the Ægis
of a beggar's life, and shields him from the invasion of policemen.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. Never be lame and blind together in the same town. One
infirmity at a time is enough for the coldest sympathy.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. Run sedulously after Quakers and fat ladies, especially if you
have with you at the time a wife and a large family.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. Never fail to sing out well in cold weather. If you have three
or four little boys and girls, of mixed sizes, to sing with you, all the
better. Always choose the middle of the street to give effect to
your voices.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. You must be "frozen out" regularly ever winter, and mount
duty in the streets, with a pitchfork, tipped with a cabbage, over
your shoulder.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. Your costume in each season must be the opposite of that
usually worn; that is to say, during the winter, a pair of very thin
trousers and a corazza will be all you require. Shiver violently, and
chatter your teeth as often as a person passes you. A sailor's hat,
striped shirt, and canvas trousers, are not bad in a country town.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. Mind, in your orations, you "haven't tasted food for three
days," and make a practice of picking up bones, or old crusts, out
of the gutter, and gnawing them, if there is any one looking at you.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. Never be too modest, if any one has relieved you, to ask for
"an old coat, or a pair of old shoes." Recollect, Holywell Street is
not too proud to purchase the most worthless of wearing apparel.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. Take care, if you are deaf and dumb, not to answer any one.
Suffer yourself to be taken into custody rather than notice the impertinent
questions of an officer of the Mendicity Society.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. Take care of long crossings, if you are very lame. It is extremely
unpleasant, as well as <em>infra dig.</em>, to carry your crutches and
run all of a sudden, if you happen to have at your heels a mad
bull or a racing omnibus.</p>

<p class='c000'>11. Chalk writing is unprofitable, and belongs to the old school.
If you are driven to it, don't mind about spelling incorrectly, and
be sure you are "starving." Quiet spots, like Gower Street or
Russell Square, are the best markets for this branch of the profession.
In great thoroughfares you will have your fresco or calligraphy
rubbed out by every unfeeling passer-by, and be obliged
ultimately to "walk your chalks."</p>

<p class='c008'>The returns under this head are extremely interesting, and some
curious calculations may be made from them. It appears that there
is, in England and Wales, about one lawyer to four lunatics; thus
giving him a chance of at least a couple of clients. The tables are,
however, very incomplete; for we find no account of the number of
omnibus cads, who are lumped under the head of "other educated
persons." We presume that convicts come home from transportation
are included among persons returned as independent.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>RULES FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS WALKING<br /> THE STREETS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Take as much room on the pavement as you possibly can: if you
are with four or five friends, walk all arm-in-arm together. Don't
make way for a lady; the road is plenty wide enough for her. Joke
smartly with the cabmen, and hail every omnibus which is passing,
and then walk a different way. Ask each policeman "How's G
149?" and enter into playful conversation with every beggar who
asks you for a penny. Enter newspaper shops to inquire the price
of the "Penny Magazine," and stop outside cookshops to imitate the
action of the carver. Shriek out "Lur-li-e-ty" as often as you
please, and compliment cooks and housemaids standing at area-gates.
Stop private carriages to inquire if they are "hired," and
tap stout gentlemen on the off shoulder to enjoy their surprise when
they turn round and see no one there. Buy baked potatoes in the
street to keep your hands warm, and play at catch-ball with them as
you go along. Pelt dogs with stones, or anything else you can get;
and cry "Balloon" when there is none. Converse freely with old
clothesmen, and laugh openly at persons in distress. Stare young
ladies out of countenance, and quiz aged people on their very
juvenile looks. Ring bells vigorously as you go home of an
evening, and rattle your stick violently against the area-railings,
taking good care to remove all pewter pots that may be hanging on
them.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>REASONS FOR CLOSING ATTORNEYS' OFFICES<br /> AT SIX.</h3>

<p class='c008'>The lawyers' clerks, having been bitten by the linendrapers'
shopmen, have caught the fashionable mania for "shutting up at
six," in order to give them time for that mental cultivation which
filling up writs, attending before the Master, and copying bills of
costs, are not likely to facilitate.</p>

<p class='c000'>At a recent meeting of some influential articled clerks, and a
numerous body of common-law journeymen, the following resolutions,
embodying reasons for closing attorneys' offices at six,
were unanimously agreed to:—</p>

<p class='c021'>"1. That the study of history is conducive to the cultivation of the mind.
That the performances at Astley's begin at half-past six, and it is desirable
that the clerks who are anxious to profit by the dramatic representation
of the great historical events of our own time, should have an
opportunity of doing so.</p>

<p class='c021'>"2. That it is perfectly true the Cider Cellars and the Coal Hole (where
the noblest study of mankind, which is universally allowed to be man, can
be effectually carried on) do not present many attractive features till after
nine in the evening. That, nevertheless, the cigar divans are in full
operation before that hour; and it is therefore expedient that six should be
the time appointed for the cessation of business.</p>

<p class='c021'>"3. That stout and devilled kidneys, when introduced into the animal
system too late at night, are liable to impede the action of the digestive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>organs, and impair the intellectual faculties, thus depriving the employer of
the full benefit of the clerk's shrewdness and activity. It is, therefore, of
the last importance that, by an early release from business, the stout and
kidneys may be absorbed by the gastric juices, and the gases given off, by
evaporation, in sufficient time to enable the clerk to devote a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mens sana in
corpore sano</span></i> by ten o'clock in the morning, to the best interests of his
principal.</p>

<p class='c021'>"4. That the Surrey Zoological Gardens afford opportunities for the study
of natural history, which can only be followed up by daylight. That the
habits of the bear, the tiger, and other animals, cannot be said to be without
interest to an attorney's clerk; and that the knowledge of how certain savage
creatures secure their prey may hereafter be of great service in the practice
of the legal profession. It is consequently obvious that the lawyers' clerks
should be enabled to profit by so valuable a lesson.</p>

<p class='c021'>"5. That the shooting galleries are seldom open after eight, and that the
knowledge of the use of powder and shot is essential to a lawyer, as he will
often be called upon by a client to decide whether a defendant is worth the
articles alluded to.</p>

<p class='c021'>"6. That there are many other occasions when, by an early closing of
the office, the lawyer's clerk will have an opportunity of being present
at some—"</p>

<p>STIRRING UP THE GREAT FIRE OF LONDON.</p>

</div>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>THE GREAT FIRE OF LONDON.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Among the events for which the past year will for ever remain
a marked twelvemonth on the page of history, is the Great Fire of
London, which broke out, for a considerable period, three nights
every week, as a public prediction had declared it should, regularly,
till further notice.</p>

<p class='c000'>We are fortunately enabled to give the particulars of this great
conflagration on the occasion of one of its grandest eruptions. It
commenced a little after dusk, and there can now exist no doubt
that it was the work of more than one incendiary.</p>

<p class='c000'>Flames were distinctly seen to issue from one of the windows of
Old St. Paul's (which seemed to have been renovated only to be re-consumed).
They evidently proceeded from a torch, which, we are
assured, was applied by a man in a seal-skin cap.</p>

<p class='c000'>No less than three individuals were observed, busy in assisting
the progress of the flames, by tossing ignited straw, &amp;c., about with
pitchforks. The glare distinctly revealed their shirt sleeves, thus
proving them to be without coats: but, owing to the confusion, their
faces were not identified.</p>

<p class='c000'>The devouring element was brought, by a lad in a short jacket
(said to have been out at elbows), with aid of a lighted stick, into
contact with the touch-hole of a howitzer, which exploded with a
loud noise. This proceeding was frequently repeated during the
evening,—it is believed out of mere wantonness. The same heartless
principle induced others to throw squibs, crackers, and other
fireworks into the blazing ruins.</p>

<p class='c000'>Neither the crowd nor the attendant policemen offered in the
smallest degree to interfere. The cries and shouting of the multitude
were tremendous, but seemed to partake of an exulting character.</p>

<p class='c000'>By a little past ten o'clock the flames got under, apparently of
their own accord; and, though several towers and steeples had been
seen to fall with a tremendous crash, which was heightened by the
frequent tocsin of gongs and the explosion of artillery, little damage
is imagined to have been done, the destruction having principally
extended to the fireworks and other combustibles already mentioned.</p>

<p class='c000'>The motive assigned for this act of incendiarism is sheer self-interest
on the part of the perpetrators, who received a shilling
a head from people who came to witness it. The fiendish project, we
fear, was crowned with the most complete success.</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A certain alderman, well known in town,</div>
      <div class='line'>'Twas rumoured had at last resigned his gown;</div>
      <div class='line'>Report was right, denial had been vain,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That gown, just like the gentle Desdemona,</div>
      <div class='line'>Had oft been made to turn and turn again</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And still go on, by its too thrifty owner.</div>
      <div class='line'>At length it had become disgraceful truly;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Upon economy no more he stands,</div>
      <div class='line'>But taking off his gown, resigns it duly</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Into the livery's (that's his footman's) hands.</div>
      <div class='line'>The livery servant looks into the street,—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He sees two dealers in old clothes come down;</div>
      <div class='line'>Shouts he, "I will invite them to compete</div>
      <div class='line in2'>For this now vacant aldermanic gown."</div>
      <div class='line'>They poll against each other; one is willing</div>
      <div class='line'>To give, but not to go beyond, a shilling:</div>
      <div class='line'>The other puts it to the livery's sense,</div>
      <div class='line'>By tendering on the instant thirteen pence.</div>
      <div class='line'>They wrangle, and their offers slowly raise,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Till at the self-same figure both remain;</div>
      <div class='line'>The choice the anxious livery dismays,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The vacant gown which of them ought to gain.</div>
      <div class='line'>At length it strikes the livery—of the two,</div>
      <div class='line'>The one that wears three hats must be a Jew:</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Unto the other is the gown decreed,</div>
      <div class='line'>The livery saying he is left no choice,—</div>
      <div class='line'>In fact, he's quite without a voice:</div>
      <div class='line in12'>He is, indeed!</div>
      <div class='line'>The corporation having laid it down</div>

  <h3 class='c007'>ANTIPATHIES OF REMARKABLE CHARACTERS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Almost every person who has lived in history has had some
particular antipathy. Julius Cæsar couldn't eat a periwinkle, and
Alexander always fainted at the sight of a blackbeetle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Chaucer would be unwell for days if he heard the cry of
"mackerel!" and Spenser never saw a leg of mutton without
shivering all over.</p>

<p class='c000'>Boadicea hated red whiskers: it nearly cost Caractacus his life,
because he came into her presence one day with a tremendous pair on.</p>

<p class='c000'>The smell of pickles always sent Cardinal Wolsey into hysterical
fits. He called upon Henry the Eighth once while the monarch
was lunching off some cold meat, and Wolsey fell down under the
table as soon as he smelt there was pickled cabbage in the room.
Henry, thinking the cardinal was intoxicated, had him locked up in
the Tower immediately.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cleopatra couldn't look at a person with freckles: Antony had
all his soldiers who were at all freckled painted black to please her.</p>

<p class='c000'>Napoleon took a violent hatred against any one who didn't take
snuff: it is said the cause of his separation from Josephine was
because she never would take a pinch from him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Alfred the Great could not bear the taste of suet-dumplings.</p>

<p class='c000'>Artaxerxes had such an intense horror of fleas that he would not
go to bed without a suit of armour, made like a night-gown, to fit
close to his skin. He would lose his reason for days when bitten by
one. There was a reward of ten talents, during his reign, for the
apprehension of every flea, dead or alive; and merchants would
come from far and near to claim the reward.</p>

<p class='c000'>Queen Elizabeth had the strongest antipathy to a sheriff's officer:
she would run away as fast as she could directly she saw one, and
continue running for miles, until her guards, who knew her weakness,
stopped her.</p>

<p class='c000'>Old Parr would turn pale if he touched a piece of soap: this is
the reason he never shaved. Cicero had such an antipathy to the
Wednesday that he used to remain in bed all that day; and Anna
Bolena could not hear the word "potato" pronounced without turning
violently red, and feeling low-spirited for weeks afterwards.</p>

<p class='c000'>Charles the Second never could go through Temple Bar. It
used to take the whole strength of Villiers, with Rochester and
Nell Gwynne, to push him through it. Cromwell never could pass
a tripe shop without bursting immediately into tears.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>AN ESSAY ON COMETS.<br /> BY OUR OWN ASTRONOMER.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The word "comet" has been derived by some from the Latin
<em>coma</em>, a tail; but the better derivation is <em>comma</em>, because it never
can come to a full stop.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every comet has a tail, or train, which may be compared to some
of those monster trains which are occasionally the subjects of newspaper
paragraphs.</p>

<p class='c000'>What a comet is we do not exactly know. It is certainly an
eccentric body, but there are so many eccentric bodies in these
days, that this hypothesis affords us no assistance.</p>

<p class='c000'>A comet has a curious propensity to cut and come again, at very
long intervals.</p>

<p class='c000'>Astronomers talk of the mean distance of a comet from the
earth, but as no comet ever came nearer than several thousands of
miles, which is anything but a mean distance, we should be glad to
know the meaning the astronomers attach to the word alluded to.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a comet due in 1848, being the same one that favoured
us, or rather our ancestors, with a visit at half-past eight <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, on
the 21st of April, 1556. As the "oldest inhabitant" will not have
had the honour of a previous acquaintance, it is very possible that
some other eccentric body may be mistaken for our old acquaintance
of the sixteenth century. Perhaps an inferior planet, disguised
in a long tail, may endeavour to pass himself off for the expected
visitor.</p>

<p class='c000'>The safest mode of predicting a comet is to prophesy its appearance
at least a century hence, and something luminous is
pretty sure to turn up, to enable posterity to find something like a
realization of the prediction. Any astronomer desirous of naming
an earlier day for the appearance of a comet should stipulate for
its being visible at some outlandish locality, where no witnesses
will be in attendance to test the accuracy of the prediction.</p>

<p class='c000'>The comet of 1770 has very shamefully broken its appointments
with the astronomers, and shown a degree of unpunctuality which
is no less perplexing than it is unbusinesslike. The comet ought
to have entered an appearance, according to the law of comets, every
five years and a half; but the eccentric body has been <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">non inventus</span></i>
ever since, and we should be glad to see it regularly outlawed
from the solar system.</p>

<p class='c000'>Comets are generally called periodical bodies because their tails
are so exceedingly lengthy, like those which are continued from
month to month in some of the periodicals. They differ, however,
in one respect, the former being very luminous, and the latter
utterly destitute of brilliancy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Between the years 1771 to 1780 there happened a regular glut
of comets; no less than five having appeared in the period alluded
to. This extraordinary assemblage was no doubt the first regular
specimen of a monster meeting.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>NEW LITERARY ASSOCIATION OF THE<br /> FRIENDS OF FRANCE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Professed patriots being always addicted to abusing their own
country, it is presumed that the height of patriotism would consist
in an Englishman writing leading articles for a French Radical
newspaper. With this view a few literary friends of freedom have
associated for the purpose of supplying the Parisian Press with
Anti-English leaders at a cheap rate, and the following is submitted
as a specimen of the article it is proposed to manufacture.</p>

<p class='c000'>The subject is a particularly happy one, being no less than the
solemn declaration of the King of the French (while being invested
with the Order of the Garter) that he would never make war upon
the Sovereign of the Order alluded to.</p>

<p class='c000'>The circumstance that the oath taken includes no promise or
declaration of the kind can of course be of no consequence, as the
leader is intended for a French newspaper. The following is the

<h3 class='c007'>REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON WASHHOUSES<br /> FOR THE PEOPLE.</h3>

<p class='c008'>The committee appointed to select a site for a great National
Washhouse, vacillated for some time between the Fleet Prison and
Covent Garden Theatre; but at length, for the reasons hereinafter
stated, gave the latter the preference.</p>

<p class='c000'>Covent Garden Theatre has had cold water thrown upon it so
long, that no expense need be gone to in laying on any more of
the salubrious element. The genius of the place is also favourable
to such an experiment as the one proposed, for in the event of
water being scarce, recourse might be had to some of the old pumps,
which, though rather out of use, could easily be made to act again.
These pumps possess the advantage of never causing an overflow.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is proposed to turn the pit into a drying-ground, the backs of
the seats being used for hanging clothes upon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Persons bringing their own soap cannot, on any account, be
admitted into the dress circle with mottled; and a moderate
quantity of starch will be expected in the private boxes. Tickets
for single tubs may be had at the doors, and family coppers to
admit six may be had at all the libraries.</p>

<p class='c000'>One advantage connected with the scheme for turning the theatre
into a washhouse, is the opportunity that would be afforded for
employing some of the regular company of actors, who, in the
mangling department, would be invaluable. The style in which
they have occasionally got up and mangled some of Shakspeare's
fine things ought never to be forgotten.</p>

<p class='c000'>With reference to the Fleet Prison, it is suggested by the committee
that it is scarcely adapted to ordinary washing, though for
purposes of whitewashing, it has always been found to answer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Should Covent Garden Theatre be fixed upon, due notice will be
given of its being open for the season.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>A NEW TABLE TO CALCULATE WAGES.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>This table must depend a great deal on the sort of table kept by
the master of the house in which the servant resides. As a general
rule, the dripping admits of subtraction, and by calculating how
many times the candle-box will go into the kitchen-stuff, a fair
average may be arrived at. It must also be borne in mind, that as
the water is to the milk, so is the beer-money. In families where
the cupboard is left open, it follows frequently, that as the tea is to
the sugar, so is the servant at both of them.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THINGS WHICH CAN BE MUCH BETTER CONCEIVED<br /> THAN DESCRIBED.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Getting out of an omnibus, and discovering you have left all your
money on the mantel-piece.</p>

<p class='c000'>A woman discovering her first grey hair.</p>

<p class='c000'>Putting the lighted end of a cigar into your mouth.</p>

<p class='c000'>A person's indignation on being told "Queen Anne's dead."</p>

<p class='c000'>Meeting a creditor, and being obliged to sit opposite to him "the
whole way" in an omnibus.</p>

<p class='c000'>Being asked, in a drawing-room of ladies, to take a few tickets in
a raffle—"the ticket only a guinea!"</p>

<p class='c000'>Breaking your strap in the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pas seul</span></i> in <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">La Pastorale</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wine at a public dinner.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>DIRECTIONS FOR BREWING.</h3>

<p class='c008'>One of the difficulties attendant on domestic brewing is the
expense of the cask, but this may always be got by having a barrel
of beer on trial from a regular brewer, and saying it is not quite
out when the cask is applied for. By agreeing to pay for the beer,
one barrel under the other, the expense becomes merely nominal.</p>

<p class='c000'>In order to prevent the lightning from turning the beer, a lightning
conductor should be fixed in the bung-hole of the cask, or a
stair-rod would perhaps be an economical substitute.</p>

<p class='c000'>Families who brew without exactly knowing how, may try the
experiment of a polite note to Messrs. Barclay and Perkins, asking
one of them to step round to put the parties in the right way, if
they should be making a failure of the brewing.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the beer should be flat after having been left to cool in washing-tubs,
a raisin may be thrown in, and if it fails to produce any effect,
another raisin may be tried; but should the second raisin prove
unsuccessful, it will be waste of time—and raisins—to go on with
the experiment.</p>

<p>COURT OF YOUNG ENGLAND.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>YOUNG ENGLAND.<br /> A BIOGRAPHY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The subject of the present notice was born of very obscure parents
in London, and was placed, soon after his birth, at the doors of the
Treasury, under the impression that Sir Robert Peel might stumble
over it, and be induced to take it in and provide for it. The Premier,
however, merely moved it on one side with his foot, and Young
England began to cry out very lustily; but its voice was so weak
that no one paid any attention to it. Soon after, the bantling
attracted the notice of the press, and its case was laid before the
public, but it excited very little interest; and an appeal to Old
England in favour of Young England was equally unsuccessful, the
former denying the latter to be its legitimate offspring. A novel,
entitled "Coningsby," was afterwards written, in the hope of doing
something for Young England; but the more the book was read,
the less was Young England thought of.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a curious fact, that while Young England never could
succeed in winning popularity, a rival, in the shape of Young
America, was very successful, under the name of General Tom
Thumb, who was received very graciously at Buckingham Palace.
Surely, if mere littleness confers a claim to admiration, Young
England is almost as deserving of it as General Tom Thumb, who,
on the principle that extremes often meet, frequently found himself
in the presence of greatness. Young England would give its little
finger to make its way at Court as little Thumb has done.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>ASSESSED TAXES.</h3>

<p class='c008'>As the ordinary almanacks are, in many respects, erroneous in
their information on the subject of assessed taxes, we proceed to
correct a few of the most usual inaccuracies.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is generally said that 2<em>l.</em> 8<em>s.</em> must be paid annually for armorial
bearings by persons keeping a carriage. It ought to be added,
that there is an exemption for persons keeping a cab by making it
wait for them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every additional body used on a carriage is chargeable; but when
any body additional is used on a carriage as an extra footman, he is
regarded as no body, and he is liable to no other duty than that of
getting up and down when required.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>THE POLKA PLAGUE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The year 1844 will be ever memorable in our national annals, on
account of the breaking out of a great plague, on which physiologists
have conferred the title of "Polkamania." This remarkable
affliction first originated in the Black Forests of Bohemia, where
it took the name of Polka—which is, no doubt, a corruption of
Pole-ca, a word evidently derived from the pole cat, to which, as an
excessive nuisance, the Polka has some kind of affinity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The boors, or bores, of the Black Forest communicated the Polka
to some Parisians, who always take quickly any malady of the
kind, and it very soon spread among the people of the French
capital. It was introduced into England a short time after, by a
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coryphèe</span> coming over to fulfil an engagement at Her Majesty's
Theatre. The poor fellow was, indeed, very bad with it, and it was
thought that it would have died a natural death, for it did not
seem to be very taking until Monsieur Jullien happened to catch
it, and infected several places of public amusement with the severe
calamity. The malady now spread with fearful rapidity, and even
Mr. Baron Nathan fell a victim to it in its fiercest shape, while
others of less exalted rank in the Terpsichorean world had it in a
much milder form than the Baron. The symptoms of the disease
are too well known to need a lengthy description. It causes a
contraction of the leg, and a drawing up the heel to a considerable
height, accompanied by a violent twisting of the head from side to
side, and numerous contortions of the body. It gives a strange sort
of motion to the arms, occasions a repeated stamping of the feet,
and induces altogether a singularity of action which is not to be
found in other cases of mania. It is to be expected that the malady
will soon wear itself out, like other previous visitations of a somewhat
similar character.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>SPORTS AND PASTIMES.</h3>

<p class='c008'>For the benefit of our young readers, and, indeed, for the advantage
of children of a larger growth, we subjoin a few games, adapted
to the meanest capacities, and the most limited pecuniary resources.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>THE POSTMAN.</h4>

<p class='c008'>The game of Postman is little known by the title we have given
it, but it is very frequently played at. It is a cheap amusement—if
done well; but a good deal may be lost at it, if it is not skilfully
managed. It can be played at by three or four at a time, or even
more, and it may also be indulged in by a single individual. The
game consists of giving a postman's knock at any door, and running
away as fast as possible.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>THE CABMAN.</h4>

<p class='c008'>This is a very amusing game, and is very easily played at. Fix
your eye on any particular cabman, and he will be sure to come
off his stand as rapidly as he can, thinking that you intended to
hail him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fun of the game may be increased by looking at three or four
on the same stand, when they will all rush off the rank, and you
have only to explain that you "merely looked, but don't want a
cab;" upon which they will very likely begin quarrelling with each
other, and thus add materially to your amusement.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c007'>OUR PRIZE PROPHECY.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Some of the subscribers to this Almanack have represented to us
that it is scarcely complete without a prediction, and we have, therefore,
been on the look out during the year for an eligible prophecy.
We were for some time in treaty with a professor of the cabalistic
art; but, as one of our stipulations with the soothsayer was, that
the prediction should not be paid for until it was realized, the sage,
with considerable indignation, declined the engagement. We have
consequently resolved on throwing open the prophetic department
to public competition, and we therefore invite the attention of professional
seers to the following conditions:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Prophecies must be sent in before the end of September, written
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>in plain English, without any mystifying allusions to the signs of
the zodiac.</p>

<p class='c000'>No prophecy to contradict itself more than once in the same
sentence; and where there are two results, one of which must arise,
both must not be predicted in the same paragraph.</p>

<p class='c000'>A prophecy that Sagittarius will influence the fate of a man of
rank, will not be considered as having been fulfilled by a nobleman
happening to marry, or go out of town, or come to town, in the
course of the month referred to in the alleged prediction.</p>

<p class='c000'>The assertion that the town of Birmingham is under the influence
of Aquarius will be considered a partially fulfilled prophecy—and
paid for as such—if washing and bathing establishments should be
introduced into Birmingham at about the time specified.</p>

<p class='c000'>Prophecies consisting merely of figures, and sent in as nativities,
cannot be taken into consideration, for, though they are no doubt
very correct, they are, unfortunately, wholly unintelligible.</p>

<p class='c000'>Any prophecy relating to events in Bosnia, Beretzyk in Transylvania,
and other out-of-the-way places, from which a mail never
comes, because it is never due, will be rejected, on account of the
difficulty of testing its accuracy.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>ANOTHER RAILWAY NEWSPAPER.<br /> THE RAILWAY <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">BELLE ASSEMBLÉE</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Every one who has observed the mass of railway papers that have shot
up during the past half year, must have been astonished that none, devoted
to Fashionable Railway Intelligence and Literature, have yet appeared,
appealing more especially to those who have souls above the share market.
We have the pleasure of announcing the immediate appearance of such a
periodical. We are aware that, at present, all sympathies, interests, and
affections, social and general, are absorbed by the railways; but the "Railway
Belle Assemblée," whilst it never loses sight of the mighty spirit of
the age, will contain such literature alone, as the member of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau monde</span></i>
seeks for in vain, at present, in the bewildering and endless lines of advertisements,
and the single and double supplements of the daily and weekly
press.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>The arrangement of amusements, &amp;., may be looked for as follows</em>:—A
grand race is about to take place upon the Great Western, from Paddington
to Slough, between the ten o'clock down train and a shower of rain. In
the event of fine weather, the meeting will be postponed until the next
day.</p>

<p class='c000'>A <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déjeûner à la fingers</span></i> is about to be given at the Wolverton station,
whilst the train stops, next Saturday. The pretty young lady with the dark
eyes, who makes the coffee so hot that the passengers cannot drink it, has condescended
to preside. The visitors will arrive exactly ten minutes before
they depart. A band will accompany the passengers the whole distance—round
the hats of the guards; and a pyrotechnical display will take place off
the Birmingham terminus, when the engine fires are raked out for the night.</p>

<p class='c000'>On Wednesday next, an interesting <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soirée</span></i> of men of letters will be held,
at eight o'clock, with the Post-office bags, at all the different termini. The
clerk at the Kingston station is expected to get the sack five-and-twenty
minutes after, but it will not reflect any discredit on him.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Eastern Counties Railway.</em>—An interesting lecture on steam, and the
properties of the engine, was given by the engineer of the "Blazes," locomotive,
on Tuesday, to the new stoker, on the tender. The proceedings concluded
with a private dinner of two polonies, a small loaf, and pot of half-and-half.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Important.</span>—By a recent Act of Parliament every director is liable to be
called upon to ride in front of the train, whenever it is necessary, as a buffer.
As a great part of them are men of straw, the fitness of these buffers for the
purpose is unquestionable, in addition to the chaff which they have always at
command.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>ABOLITION OF DUELLING.</h3>

<p class='c008'>The members of the various Clubs have come to the determination to put
down this atrocious custom. In the event of not being able to form a court
of honour, from the scarcity of the principal ingredient, they have decided
that all future quarrels shall be adjusted by the Carrara Water, in a gallery
suited for the purpose. And, moreover, that the Carrara Monument Company,
shall erect a tablet, to perpetuate the social death of all who may he
worsted in the meeting: anybody being corked, to be ranked, like claret in
the same state, as worthless.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>The common water-plug offers a capital medium for illustrating the leading
principles in hydrostatics and hydraulics. When opened, the effort of
water to find its own level may be turned to account, in diverting and instructive
methods by the young professors of the neighbourhood in the
absence of the police, who are, generally speaking, inimical to science. To
produce a jet, the water must either come up or come down. In the case
of a fire-plug, it comes down from the New River; and if the rates are not
paid, the company come down as well upon the delinquents <em>for</em> the money,
until the latter come down <em>with</em> it. In the Trafalgar fountains, it comes up
to the surface, but not at all to the expectations. In either case the force is
the same. This increases, in an inverse ratio, to the opposition offered;
and by compressing it at the orifice, it may be thrown in any direction by a
little judicious management of the sole of the foot. In this manner, benevolent
boys may frequently be seen distributing water gratuitously to the passing
pilgrims.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THINGS TO BE BORNE IN MIND IN JANUARY.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Recollect, if you slip down in the street this month not to evince any pain,
but rather laugh: get up smiling, and walk away with a joyous air.</p>

<p class='c000'>Do not try rashly to cut the outside edge on the Serpentine, but practise

cat did it?"</p>

always dines at five;" but won't state a time?</p>

<p class='c000'>5. When a married couple are more than usually affectionate, and use endearing
terms, in public?</p>

<p class='c000'>6. When a lady, holding out her glass for some wine at a supper, says,
"Oh, really; the least drop in the world, Mr. Smith: stop, stop?"</p>

<p class='c000'>7. When the clown, a sweep, and a milk-pail, are all on the stage together,

weaker towards the end of the evening?</p>

<p class='c008'>Buy a bottle of reviver to renovate your coat and trousers for
forthcoming parties. Rout up old kid gloves, and send them to be
cleaned.</p>

<p class='c000'>That, on the 14th, if there is any one you wish to insult, it can be
done cheaply and anonymously by a valentine, without the chance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>of being tricked in return; whilst the shaft rankles the more,
because it is not known who has sent it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Do not accept an invitation to Hampshire for wild-duck shooting,
unless you wish to catch a rheumatism that will last you for life.
This sport consists in sitting all night up to the knees in mud,
half frozen, armed with a long gun, which your fingers are too
cold to let off. This, however, is your only chance of safety, as, if
it did go off, the recoil would knock you backwards, and you would
never get up again.</p>

<p class='c000'>In early times the greater part of the month was dedicated to the
Saxon god, <em>Thaw</em>.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>FIRE ESCAPES.</h3>

<p class='c008'>The frequency of accidents from fire renders some certain
method of escape desirable. The following have received medals:—</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/i_146a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The first is founded on those
ingenious machines we find in
the Dutch toy-boxes, for causing
soldiers, ducks, sheep, and even
tea things, to march, deploy, and
fall into lines, in the most
orderly manner. One of these
will be kept at the corner of
every street, and,
by the aid of four
policemen, will always
raise the preserver, or
lower the preserved,
in this manner.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_146b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The next is simply by a
parachute, formed of canvas,
which may be folded up,
and kept in the window-seat.
Should there be any wind, the
inmates will be carried to the
end of the street, and perhaps
further, which is of course, an
advantage. An ingenious architect
recommends that the
ceiling of every room should
be a shower-bath on a large
scale, always charged. This
is practicable, but in the event of the bath going off when
there was no fire, the results would be very inconvenient.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lady-day is the 25th. If you mean to change your residence about
that time, bespeak a van in time, large enough to carry off everything
at once without coming back again. But as March is a
month in which the wind is generally very easily raised, hope for
the best.</p>

<p class='c000'>That Parliament gets into full swing this month; therefore, give
up all notion of seeing a newspaper in a coffee-room under an hour
after the sixth gentleman has applied for it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The world of fashion is beginning to awaken. Change from the
chrysalis state of the twelve shilling tweed to the butterfly transition
of the guinea paletot. High-lows are, however, still to be met with
on wet evenings, in damp situations. The gossamer sometimes
takes flight this month to distant regions, therefore procure a piece
of string.</p>

<p class='c000'>Should you be unfortunately incarcerated for debts exceeding
£20, Nicol's registered paletot will be the most suitable wear, as
the advertisements say, that wearing it insures a general sense of
freedom.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>TO FIND OUT WHICH WAY THE WIND BLOWS</h3>

<p class='c008'>Go into Trafalgar Square, on a breezy day, without a mackintosh
or umbrella. Then stand under St. Martin's cab-stand when the
fountains are playing. If you get wet through immediately, the
wind is due W.; if it takes a little time to do so, it is N.W., or
S.W.; but if you remain quite dry, it is N., S., or E., which can only
be ascertained by standing respectively at the foot of the column,
under the terrace, or before the club. It hath rarely been known to
fail.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE TRADE WIND GENERATOR.</h3>

<p class='c008'>A very civil engineer, residing in Liverpool, has favoured us with
his plan for raising whatever winds may be necessary to ships, for
the purpose of commerce. His idea is, to fix a colossal pair of
double-action bellows, worked by steam power, at the stern of every
ship, which, being put in action, will blow directly on the sails, and
propel the vessel in any given direction. This entirely precludes
the chance of a ship ever becoming becalmed. He candidly tells us
that he cannot claim the entire credit of the invention; and he can
remember the late Mr. Joseph Grimaldi working something to the

being made in this instance of a washing-tub, and rigged with a
mop stolen for that purpose from an itinerant vendor, no clear

<p class='c000'>The month of April is showery, therefore get an umbrella; but
remember, that whilst it is fine, a cotton one at half-a-crown looks
as well in an oilskin case as a silk one at a guinea; and that when
it is wet, nobody cares what you have, never stopping to look.</p>

<p class='c000'>That you must renew your acquaintance with all sorts of editors
to get orders to the Opera, and thus move in the great world at a
small outlay. N.B.—Gloves worn the evening before at a party
are sufficiently presentable in the pit.</p>

<p class='c008'>Shoes came into Englande with Henry the Fourth his wife, Joan of Navarre.
Before that time the nobles did wear dried flat fish, cunningly tied
on with thongs of hide. And hence the name of <em>soles</em> as used to this day,
and by alle men.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1580, a shower of potatoes did fall in Lancashire, at which the husbandmen
were sorelie afraid. They were sayde to have been brought from
America in a whirlwind, and, being hitherto unknown, became directly
common.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>The Polka is a measure danced by salvage men and women in Hongrie.
<em>Item.</em>—Sir Francis Drake assures me he hath seen it kept up for twenty
minutes and more, until the salvages were like to drop; the reason whereof
is difficult to tell; but he takes it to be a religious ceremony, as the whirling
dervishes in the Indies doe practise.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tobacco is a plant growing in China on inaccessible mountains, whence it
is plucked by people in balloons made of fish-skin, and preserved in red
leather bottles underground. Sir Walter Raleigh did use it first. Its vapour
inhaled is an admirable narcotic; and one Master Aytoun, deprived of it, did,
in its stead, smoke strips of Blackwood's Magazine; but this well nigh coste
him his life.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first drinking glasse used in Englande had no foote whereon to stand
(to encourage drinking), but fell alway; and was hence called a tumbler.</p>

<p class='c000'>A Bristow man, living at Castile, did learn the art of making soap, which
he set up here: and straightway upon this it became common to wash one's
self twice and thrice in the week. Nay, Mrs. Gregoire, the commissioner his
wife, did cleanse her hands, and eke her face each daie. Soe that it was soon
the rage; and people before they went to stay with such and such a one
would saie to him, "How are you off for soape?" meaning therebye that if
he had not good store, they would none of him; and soe went on their way
betymes.</p>

<p class='c000'>I do remember when they did call cats <em>Tomassins</em>, which, being corrupted
to Tom, is still in use with the vulgar; but the etymologie thereof I could
never learn, save that the word came from Flanders. <em>Item.</em>—My good friend,
Mr. Marmy, assures me that he heard them shriek and cry like infants,
beneath his chambers; such as could only be frighted by tossing the fire-irons
and fender about their ears. But he verilie believes they were devils' imps
and familiars. <em>Item.</em>—Mr. Glanville gave him a charm to exorcise them,
which is as follows, writ on fayre parchment:—</p>

<p class='c000'>The which being pronounced, they would frantically take to their heels and
scuffle off like mad, to return no more.</p>

<p class='c000'>To preserve beer from being soured by thunder:—<em>Summa</em>, it is best to
drinke it all off before the storm. They doe practise this in Kent with certainty,
and other parts of England. This also on the authority of Mr. Glanville.</p>

<p class='c000'>Men in liquor have droll conceites. 1 knew such a one, being a justice of
the peace, who, when tipsie, would take off his peruke to salute the company
with obeisance, and then, putting it on a bottle, would sing a song that had
neither beginning nor end, but went merrilie on over again: the which he
wold never stop until earned awaie to bed. And yet he was well to doe, and
a clever man, but lacked prudence.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>THE ZODIAC—MAY.<br /> GEMINI.—THE TWINS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The new explanation which our artist has put forward, of the origin of the
term <em>Gemini</em>, so clearly tells its own story, that any further remarks upon
the subject from us are unnecessary. The situation of the twins, however,
suggests that we should make some allusion to the state of the Clowns of
England; on which subject we purpose bringing out a work in the same style
as the Wives, Mothers, Queens, and other female facts of the said favoured
country.</p>

<p class='c000'>The progress of burlesques at the various theatres has done much to injure
pantomimes; and it is feared the race of Clowns will become extinct,
unless, in these days of educational enlightenment, some means are taken to
train up fresh ones as the old ones drop off. To this end, we mean to establish
a school for infant Clowns, who will be taught practical jokes in classes;
and old ladies, shopkeepers, lodging-letters, and little boys, will be provided
for them to play off their tricks upon. Proper works will be provided for
them to study: and from one of the most elementary, not yet published, we
make the following extract; premising that the Clown to a travelling circus
is the first step on the ladder of pantomimical perfection:—</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Merryman.</em> Yes, sir. (<em>Counts his fingers.</em>) Ten, twenty-eleven, fourteen,

<p class='c000'><em>Master.</em> What are you doing, sir?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Merryman.</em> I'm telling them, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Master.</em> Nonsense, Mr. Merryman. I mean you are to tell them the
nature of the exhibition.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Merryman.</em> That's capital good.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Merryman.</em> That's better still.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Master.</em> What is better still, Mr. Merryman?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Merryman.</em> Pork and parsnips.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Master.</em> Sports and pastimes, sir (<em>sternly</em>).</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span><em>Merryman.</em> Now I've got it. Times and passports.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Merryman.</em> Now keep still, can't you? You'll take all the whicksters off
my calves.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Master.</em> Now, Mr. Merryman, inform the company the nature of the performances
as exhibited before all the—</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Merryman.</em> Exhibited before all the—</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Master.</em> Potentates in Europe.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Merryman.</em> Potatoes in Europe. (<em>Confidentially, to the crowd.</em>) That's a lie.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Master</em> (<em>sharply</em>). What did you say, sir?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Merryman.</em> I said, they'd see it all by-and-by.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Master.</em> Dancing on the tight and slack rope—</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Merryman.</em> Prancing on the slight and tack rope—</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Master.</em> Remember the price. Halloo! (<em>Through a speaking trumpet.</em>)
<em>Three</em>pence each is all we ask! Servants and working people <em>two</em>pence!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Merryman.</em> Recollect: be in time. All in to begin! <em>Three</em>pence each
is all we ask; but we'll take as much more as you like to give us. All in
there! all in! [<em>Exeunt company, to re appear in one minute.</em></p>

<hr class='c019' />

<p class='c000'>This will give a fair notion of the value of the work. In addition to a
series of such helps to education, phrases, to be committed to memory, will
be hung round the room. These will be principally for the pantomimists,
and will consist of sentences like the following:—"Here we are again! how
are you?" "Now, don't be a fool!" "Here's somebody coming!" "I saw
him do it, sir!" with other similar ones.</p>

<p class='c000'>The co-operation of all friendly to the interests of the Clowns is earnestly
requested to promote the welfare of this institution.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THINGS TO BE BORNE IN MIND IN MAY.</h3>

<p class='c008'>That there is an ancient quaint rhyme, as follows—the old almanacks
having a wrong version:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"In April,</div>
      <div class='line'>Grisi opes her bill;</div>

      <div class='line'>To hear her you pay;</div>
      <div class='line'>In June,</div>
      <div class='line'>She's in full tune;</div>
      <div class='line'>In July,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her benefit is nigh;</div>
      <div class='line'>In August,</div>
      <div class='line'>Take a stall you must."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>That the only Poles now found in May, about London, are the distressed
patriots in the cheap eating-houses and copper hells in the neighbourhood of
Leicester Square. The sport is not extinct, as little boys may still be seen
dancing round the more eccentric specimens of the class. The only reason
that these poles have not fallen down, like those in the country, is, that they
are supposed to be very hard up.</p>

<p class='c000'>That although the almanacks declare that perch, ruff, bream, gudgeon,
flounders, dace, minnows, trout, and eels may be taken this month, this, to
say the least of it, requires confirmation. We have tried often, but never
took anything, except taking ourselves off after a fruitless time.</p>

negro race of the Southern States, the terrible Land-Crab, was upon them.
Copper Joe, never remarkable for heroism, lost the small remains of presence
of mind which the encounter with the Comanches had left him, and, in attempting
to fly, fell prostrate, injuring his abdomen severely. Andromache, with
her youthful charge, after a vain effort to rouse her fat husband, Noah, to
resistance, joined in the general rout. But the heroic Sambo stood his
ground. His eyes glared, his white teeth shone from ear to ear, as, with
right foot firmly planted in advance, he stood a sable Antinous, awaiting, with
uplifted club, two onsets of the terrible enemy. It was a dreadful moment!"</p>

Cromwell would have been, had he deserved it.</em>" As the villains of one age
are generally the heroes of the next, in another hundred years the whole
nation may set up a statue to him unanimously, and then the place will be
ready.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE FARCE ASSURANCE COMPANY.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Professor Bachhoffner, of the Royal Polytechnic Institution, has submitted
a plan to the managers of the different theatres, whereby the ill-effects
resulting from the summary damnation of various farces may be avoided. He
proposes to erect a gasometer, contiguous to each theatre, to be filled, on the
first nights of comic dramas, with laughing gas, which, being distributed
through various ventilators, at the last bars of the overture, will keep the
audience in screams of cachinnation throughout the performance; so that the
papers can conscientiously speak of "peals of laughter," and "hurricanes of
applause." By the same means, the talented Professor also proposes to turn
on carbonic acid gas, diluted with atmospheric air, to depress the spirits, for
serious five-act legitimacy, and induce sleep.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THINGS TO BE BORNE IN MIND IN JUNE.</h3>

<p class='c008'>If you go down to Ascot races on an old Norwich coach, at twenty shillings
a head, when you leave it and get on the course, say, "a man you know (the
coachman) brought you down on his drag (the coach)." In going home be
careful to conceal yourself, that you may not be discovered jolly, pelting open
landaus with pin-cushions, or making a banner of your pocket-handkerchief
tied to a walking-stick. Do not go up to carriages whose inmates you know
until the race is over: you will then get lunch, and will not be asked by the
girls to join a sweepstakes, which never pays.</p>

<p class='c000'>If not in funds, hide at home, on the Derby day; and when you go out at
night declare you never saw a better race. The position of the horses may
be read for nothing on the pen-and-ink placard outside the <em>Globe</em> and <em>Sun</em>
offices.</p>

<p class='c000'>The angler this month will find fish most abundant at Blackwall and Greenwich.
Almost all sorts may be readily taken with brown bread and butter.</p>

<p class='c000'>That otter hunting is in season this month, as the almanacks gravely
assure us. When the thermometer stands at ninety in the shade, there cannot
well be <em>"otter" hunting</em>.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE BOUQUET PROJECTOR, OR CERITO CATAPULT.</h3>

<p class='c008'>The great difficulty experienced in throwing bouquets to popular
performers has long been the subject of complaint at the Opera
and other theatres. It is calculated that, in every twelve bouquets
thrown at the stage, three fall in the stalls, four hit
the fiddles, two reach the proscenium (one of which tumbles
at the feet of somebody it was not intended for), and
the rest fly into the pit-boxes, where they were
never meant to go, or break into pieces in the
air, showering down like floricultural rockets upon
the heads of the spectators. To remedy this inconvenience
the Cerito catapult has been invented.
It consists of a gun working with a
spring; and the nicest aim can be taken,
as it is screwed on to the front of the
box. N.B.—Double-barrelled machines
for a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pas de deux</span></i>; and bouquets prepared,
like grapeshot, to tumble into thirty
small ones, for danseuses Viennoises and
Anglaises.</p>

We believe, from many others, that the following will be most likely

<p class='c000'>A design for a new dance against next season, by the Terpsichorean professors,
to meet the depression in their trade, since everybody knew the Polka.</p>

<p class='c000'>A design of the journalists of England to make the gentlemen of the bar
understand their proper position.</p>

<p class='c000'>A design of the journalists of France to attribute their thrashing in Algeria
to the gold of "perfide Albion."</p>

<p class='c000'>A design of the <cite>Times</cite> newspaper to expose the railway swindles and
burst all the bubbles.</p>

<p class='c000'>A design of certain medical students against the knockers and bell-pulls
near Guy's and St. Thomas's.</p>

<p class='c000'>A design for a human oven, to enable savage aborigines to cook their
victims instead of eating them raw, by Colonel Pelissier; a laudable attempt
to exhibit the refinements of French colonization.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>HISTORICAL MEMORANDA:<br /> KINDLY FURNISHED TO THE EDITOR BY THE MEMBERS OF THE OLD<br /> ORIGINAL "ARCHÆOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION," RESPECTING<br /> THE NEW HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>According to Fitzwalker, a monk who wrote in the middle ages,
the first House of Commons was so called from having been the
only house in the centre of the commons, which formed the site of
the present city of Westminster. It was built by King Cole, from
a portion of the ruins of Thebes, whence the stones were brought
in that monarch's one-horse chaise to save expense; and as only
one could be carried at a time, the journeys backwards and forwards
took many years. Subsequently, a peculiar species of cake was
manufactured there for the king, termed <em>parliament</em>; and from the
officers of state being accustomed to eat this during their debates,
the senate took its name. This structure was burnt down in 1834,
by catching fire from the inflammatory speech of an Irish member;
and its rebuilding was entrusted to Mr. Barry, the celebrated clown
at Astley's. Much speculation has taken place as to whether the
lady of this clever pantomimist and architect is the one addressed
by Mr. Tennyson, in "Locksley Hall," in the line—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>"As the husband, so the wife is: thou art mated to a clown."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Barry celebrated the laying of the first stone by driving four
ducks on the Thames, from Battersea to Westminster, in a washing-tub,—being
half of the identical butt in which the Earl of
Malmsey was drowned by the Duke of Clarence, afterwards
William IV., in the presence of Shakspeare, Hume, and
Macready.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_177.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The notorious Guy, Lord Vaux, celebrated for blowing up the
house, was captured in the vaults of the building. In trying to
escape he dislocated both his ankles,—as may be always seen in the
likenesses of him, carried about on the 5th of November, when the
feet are invariably hind-side before.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>The Speaker of the House of Commons is so called from never
opening his mouth. He has, however, to take in all the members
choose to spout, and therefore may be regarded as the Uncle of the
senate, King Alfred being the Father, or, according to others, Mr.
Byng. But this affinity does not constitute any degree of relationship
between Mr. Byng (or King Alfred) and the Speaker, any more
than Mr. Boyle's having been the father of chemistry, made his
brother, if he had one, chemistry's uncle.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>MARTYRS OF SCIENCE.</h3>

<p class='c008'>It is lamentable to think that so many of those whose discoveries
have tended to advance the general welfare of society have fallen
victims either to their zeal in the pursuit, or the apathy of the
public. The following instances will sufficiently prove the fact:—</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>James Watt</span>,</h4>

<p class='c008'>Acting upon the Greek maxim, <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">γνωθι σεαυτον</span>, devoted his whole
life to solving the mysterious problem of "what's what?" Yet he
burst his boiler eventually, and, as he was accustomed with a
melancholy facetiousness to remark, was seldom able to fill his own
stuffing-box. He choked himself with a new roll, which was in
consequence termed a penny buster. His great bust was the work
of Chantrey. To him we owe the invention of the baked-tater can.
His hymns have been much admired.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Newton</span>,</h4>

<p class='c008'>The great inventor of the solar system, was descendant of the Earl
of Orrery. He discovered the centrifugal force from watching the
scenes in the circle at Astley's. Whilst seated in his usual place in
the pit one night, he was hit on the head by an apple from the
gallery, supposed to have been aimed at Widdicombe, which led him
to the discovery of the gravity of the earth, though it destroyed that
of the house. Yet this great man was in his old age reduced to
keep an eating-house near Leicester Square, formerly called the
Hotel Newton, but now better known as Berthollini's.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Dr. Jenner</span>,</h4>

<p class='c008'>Whilst in the incipient stages of small-pox, was tossed by a cow,
which led him to the discovery of vaccination. Yet he was often
without the means of procuring a ha'porth of milk; so that he was
wont to say, when in a merry mood, that although his discovery had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>extirpated the confluent state, it had not left him in an affluent one.
Cowes was his favourite residence, where he died in a state of monomania,
fancying himself one of them.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Harvey</span>,</h4>

<p class='c008'>Invented the circulation of the blood; yet he composed his "Meditations
amongst the Tombs" with no other stimulus than a bottle
of his own sauce, during an excursion to Kensal Green. Ultimately,
coming to poverty, he took the situation of Hermit, at Vauxhall,
and lived upon pulse. His works are now only found at circulating
libraries.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Priestley</span>,</h4>

<p class='c008'>Although he discovered the properties of air, had not sufficient
property of his own to raise the wind. He found out the composition
of the atmosphere; but was unable to effect a composition
with his creditors. During the "<span class='sc'>No Popery</span>" riots his house was
torn down by the mob, who said they would have "none of that <em>air</em>."
He afterwards travelled about the country with lucifer matches,
whence he has been erroneously termed a light porter. He died
ultimately from want of breath, ungratefully deserted by that
element which he had raised from obscurity, and left his discoveries
as an <em>heir</em>loom to the nation. He died in a Wynd in Edinburgh,
but his remains were afterwards removed to Ayr, where an humble
admirer afterwards inscribed this terse but touching epitaph upon
his tomb:—</p>

<p class='c008'>Until he came of age, was originally a miner in the north of England,
where he invented the wonderful lamp, mentioned in the Arabian
Nights. Hence each miner, on entering the pit, is required to "take
his davy," or he will otherwise be blown up. He was very fond of
salmon-fishing, but was never known to catch any. Poverty having
depressed his spirits he took to laughing gas, and this, combining
with other gases which he was accustomed to swallow in large
quantities, produced spontaneous combustion, of which he died,
whilst at sea, and was there interred in his own locker. During
three days in the week he might be seen in the park, dining with
his noble godfather, the Duke Humphrey. Such was the fate of
one, of whom we may say, in the words of the poet:—</p>

"shot this morning," and send them where you think the attention
will pay best. In that way you are much more certain to make a

<p class='c000'>If you are a member of parliament, get a "pair," that you may be
off to your manor, this being now the custom. If you like stag-hunting,
you had better stay on a railway committee.</p>

<p class='c000'>If you meet a friend, complain of being dull and the emptiness
of London: this looks as if your acquaintances were in the habit of
going out of town; the fact being, that no one you know leaves
London from one year's end to the other except your tailor.</p>

<p class='c000'>If you are a barrister, you are expected to be on circuit at this
time; but as this is expensive when you have no brief, put a placard
on your outer door, "On the Northern Circuit," and live in a single
room at Manor Cottage, Kennington, or a similar locality.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF THE ASTLEY'S<br /> ASSOCIATION<br /> FOR THE DIFFUSION OF GENERAL INFORMATION.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>This meeting, first established by Professor Widdicombe, the father of the
Antiquarian Society, promises to become a most important institution.
Through the urbanity of the Professor, who has spent a very long life—in
fact, so long as to be almost fabulous—in collecting information on various
points not apparently properly understood, we have been favoured with the
"Report;" and from it we propose to make various extracts, premising, that
"The Bride of the Nile," "The Conquest of Amoy," "The Battle of Hastings,"
"The ditto of Waterloo," with other dramas, have furnished the
authorities.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>THE WONDERS OF ANCIENT EGYPT.</h4>

<p class='c008'>The mysteries of Isis, amongst the ancient Egyptians, were more simple
than they are generally supposed to be; the sacred fires being trimmed with
tow and turpentine every evening, and not being perpetual, but lighted with
a lucifer, when wanted to juggle the multitude. The High Priests received
six shillings a week for keeping them in order; and when the ceremonies
were over, they frequently changed their costume and mingled with the
crowd, to assist the deception. Celibacy was not insisted on, as several were
married men, with families, residing in Lambeth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although in the chariot and gladiatorial contests of the Egyptians desperate
struggles took place, yet all animosity ceased when the fight was over.
Many of them, as they prepared for the contest, shared the Memphian baked
potato, or the cold without, with much good-fellowship; and it was not
uncommon, after the fight, to see the victor tending the foe whom he had
forced to bite the dust until his mouth was full of it, and it required washing
down with beer.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>THE WAR IN CHINA.</h4>

<p class='c008'>A little circumstance connected with the taking of Amoy was not mentioned
in the despatches. After Sir Henry Pottinger had addressed the
troops they rushed away cheering, whilst he remained and made his horse
dance a hornpipe for five minutes to the band, although he was directly under
the ramparts. This is an unparalleled instance of coolness and self-possession
in a moment of danger.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>EARLY WIT, ETC.</h4>

<p class='c008'>Jokes were common amongst the Normans. Before "The Battle of Hastings,"
when Harold's envoy came to know on what principle William invaded
Britain, William replied, "Tell your master we will return his wrongs with
<em>interest</em>, and teach him <em>principle</em>." The barons did not laugh, probably from
etiquette; but this must have been a good joke in those days.</p>

<p class='c000'>Harold was killed by an arrow, as is commonly believed. It was, however,
a species of suicide, as he stuck it into his head himself, on the sly, not
choosing to trust to the archery of the soldiers. Considering the lightness of
the dress in which he went to battle it is a wonder he was not killed before.
His armour was simply rings of tin, tacked upon cotton velvet.</p>

<p class='c000'>The story of the old chroniclers that Harold survived the battle, receives
some confirmation from the fact that half an hour after the contest he was
seen, muffled in a Tweed, asking the price of some sausages in the New Cut.
These were probably to subsist on in his retirement.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Norman William celebrated his conquest by taking a pipe and a glass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>of grog, with one particular friend, at an hostelry adjoining the scene of
action, when it was all over.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_191.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h4 class='c017'>TREACHERY AT WATERLOO</h4>

<p class='c008'>According to the latest Astley authorities, dated last June, the Battle of
Waterloo occupied six minutes exactly. Several French soldiers walked
undisguisedly into the quarters of the English army before the fight commenced;
and some, at the extreme back of the scene, fought indiscriminately
on either side, as occasion required. But the gravest circumstance is, that
in the heat of the action the Duke of Wellington,
approaching Marshal Soult, said to him, "Don't let your
fellows fire until mine have!" a course which must have
led them to destruction, had not General Widdicombe
roared, with a voice of thunder, "What the devil are
you doing there, you stupid asses?"—which produced
the last grand charge. The story of the ball at
Brussels is an idle invention. The officers were at
no ball at all; except two, who had visited Mr. Baron
Nathan's assembly at Kensington but a little time
previously: and as to their being taken by surprise,
they knew for weeks what was coming, even to the very
hour and minute of the attack, and the precise manner
in which it would be made. The following beautiful
lines are but little known, and well deserve a place in this report.
They are the production of Lord Byron, and were written at the request of
the late Andrew Ducrow, Esq., describing the scene immediately before the
commencement of the battle.</p>

<p class='c008'>When you come back to town do not say to what precise part of
the Continent you have been, or you may be found out; "A Walking
Tour in Norway" is, however, tolerably safe; and the principal
objects may be read up from Murray's "Handbook." If you were
seen at the aforesaid Margate, or Gravesend (as the case may be),
say you were obliged to go one day to the horrid place, to see a fellow
who had sold you a horse.</p>

<p class='c000'>That if you are in debt, the heavy fogs will allow you to walk past
the doors of your principal creditors, which will open several new
promenades to you.</p>

<p class='c000'>If you wish to pass for a fox-hunter, take a day ticket on the
Birmingham rail, in the second-class carriages, in pink and leathers.
Everybody will then suppose you have a horse in a box behind—an
impression of which you are not bound to disabuse them. This is
what in melodramas is called "joining the hunting train."</p>

<p class='c008'>These popular ornaments, whose capabilities for jokes have nearly been
exhausted, are about to receive a new interest from the application of an old
philosophical fact. It is well known that a jet of water will support any
hollow conical body as long as it plays: it is therefore in contemplation to
place an Albert hat on the top of each fountain, which will be kept at a certain
elevation, and form an appropriate accompanying trophy to the Nelson
column; the two portraying the United Service.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>HISTORICAL MEMORANDA.<br /> DRURY LANE THEATRE.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Drury Lane Theatre was built in 1667, one year after the great
fire of London, by Mr. William Shakspeare, assisted by Mr. Bunn,
a great dramatist, from the designs of Mr. Planché, an eminent
architect. Shakspeare was an extraordinary musician; and his solos
on the ophicleide, whilst in the orchestra of the Globe Theatre,
were much admired. He composed several musical dramas, amongst
which "Hamlet, Prince of Tyre," "As You Like It, or So I hope
you'll recommend it," "The Two Gentlemen of Windsor," "Antony
and Juliet," have gained a transient popularity. He was originally
in trade at Stratford-upon-Avon, but being convicted of "stagging"
on the Charlecote Line, he fled to London, and assumed the name of
Fitzball, under which cognomen he published his best pieces. He
was buried, at his own request, in the rotunda of the theatre, under
the fireplace, where his monument may be seen for nothing on going
to take places.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>HINTS TO NOVELISTS, FOR 1846.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The increasing demand for this species of literature, whether with
or without a purpose—the latter style being, perhaps, the most
popular—has called forth a number of new pens to meet it. Some
of these being rather new at their work, stand in need of a little
assistance; and we are most happy in being able to give it, in the
shape of those methods of commencing a tale which experience has
shown to be the most successful, and hence the most universally
followed:—</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE READ-UP, OR JAMESONIAN.</h3>

<div class='c008'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/i_197di.jpg' width='200' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi1'>
<span class='sc'>If</span> we examine closely the records of the past, we
shall find that the principal source of the public
morality, or vice, springs in most cases from the
acts or institutions of the government; and this
was especially remarkable at the commencement of
the seventeenth century, in France. The youth of
Louis XIII.; the feebleness of his character, even
in advanced age; his incapacity, and that of his
regent mother, gave rise to all kinds of imperfections,
and opened the career to excesses of feudality,
and all sorts of lawless ambitions. Evil, departing
from this centre, spread amongst all classes of
people: the organization of the clergy affected the
position of the laity; and the intrigues of the
Count de Soissons, Condé, and others, favoured the
general corruption.</p>

<p class='c000'>Things stood thus when, one fine spring morning, two horsemen
in military attire were slowly traversing one of the large tracts of
forest land which then stretched between Compiègne and Beauvais.</p>

<p class='c000'>[<em>At this point search the British Museum, and get up the costumes
from pictures. The "low countries" is effective.</em>]</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE PSEUDO-GRAPHIC, OR WEAK BOZ-AND-WATER.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Any one whom business or pleasure has taken across Hungerford
Bridge may have observed, on the right hand, as he reached the
Lambeth side of the river, a curious tumbledown-looking counting-house,
something between a travelling caravan and the city barge,
elevated on some rickety piles, with a rusty balcony projecting
from its river front, and without any visible means of access or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>egress, except down the chimney, or along a rotten row of spouts,
barely fastened to its decaying woodwork. It is a dismal, melancholy
place. The glass has been untouched for years, and is coated
with dirt, although through it may be seen files of old dust-covered
papers, hanging amidst festooned cobwebs and corroded inkstands,
with stumps of pens still sticking in the holes. Everything tells of
broken hearts and ruined fortunes; of homes made desolate by
misplaced confidence, and long, long lawsuits, which outlived those
who started them, and were left—with nothing else, to the poor and
struggling heirs!</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a miserable November evening: the passengers were
glooming through the haze of the feeble lights, choked by the river
fog, like dim spectres; and a melancholy drip fell, in measured
plashings, from every penthouse and coping, as two figures slowly
pursued their way towards this dreary place, through some of the
old and tortuous streets that lie between the York Road and the
river side.</p>

<p class='c000'>[<em>The heroes (as the case may be) being thus introduced, the author
can go ahead with his plot, if he has one.</em>]</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE TOPOGRAPHICAL, OR TRANSATLANTIC.</h3>

<p class='c008'>The long chain of rocky mountains which, reaching from the
Oregon to New York, forms a natural boundary to the prairies on
the Canada side of the Mississippi, is more than once crossed by
rugged tracks, left by the early emigrants to the far west shores of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>the continent. These are here and there dotted with villages,
whose buildings bear traces of their Dutch origin, and watered by
streams flowing through the hunting grounds of the Pawnee and
Webfooted Indians, until they mingle with the roar of Niagara,
above Buffalo.</p>

<p class='c000'>[<em>Having settled your scene in this locality, you go on about the
Indians as follows:</em>—]</p>

<p class='c000'>"That's the crack of a tarnal rifle from them Mingoes," said the
Scamp, as he listened to the report; "why on 'arth they're not
shot off like nat'ral animals is just above my comprension."</p>

<p class='c000'>His Indian companion looked to the ground with a low expressive
"Hugh!" and picked up a shell.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The Huron is a coward," he said: "his squaw is idle in his
wigwam; and his mocassins are weak. The Ojibbeway will have
his scalp."</p>

<p class='c000'>"The creetur is right," replied the Scamp: "I'd back the
downey cove's rifle against any blazer them infarnal Mingoes ever
struck fire into."</p>

<p class='c000'>[<em>The Indians should always speak in the third person: "fire-water,"
"great spirit," "pale-faces," "wampum," &amp;c., will add to the
effect; and the general habits may be ground up from recollections
of the Egyptian Hall.</em>]</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE ECLOGIC, OR GOREAN.</h3>

<p class='c008'>"Then you will be sure and come?" said Lillie Effingham, as the
party of handsome girls and young men, with whom she was riding,
turned through the opening, on to the turf, at the side of the
Serpentine.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Can you mistrust me?" replied her cavalier, in a low, impressive
tone, that conveyed a far deeper meaning than the four words.
"Shall not you be there?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, that is all very well, I know," answered Lillie, patting, with
her small hand, the glossy neck of her Arabian; "but Blanche
Heathcote will be there as well, and Lady Helen, and the bewitching
Mrs. Howard; you will be at no loss for attractive partners."</p>

<p class='c000'>Charles Trevor—for such was his name—smiled with a peculiar
expression; then, raising his hat to Lillie, pranced off to speak to
some men in the Guards, with whom he was to dine that day at the
Palace mess.</p>

<p class='c000'>[<em>The reader is now to be let into the secret of who these two individuals
are.</em>]</p>

<p class='c008'>Everybody knows those kisses, burnt almonds and sugar-plums, in their
envelopes of fringed and gaudy paper, with the concealed Waterloo cracker
inside, which it is so delightful to explode during
supper-time at an evening party; and everybody
also knows that the motto which this discharge
of enlivening artillery sets free is generally the
most stupid, unmeaning thing it is possible to
conceive. From a quantity we select the following
as a fair specimen of the prevailing style:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>Love's like a trifle, fleeting soon;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Vows are the froth, and man the spoon.</div>

last year, has come to hand; and, fully convinced
that everything put down in it will happen, sooner or
later—or, if it does not, that it ought to have done so;
and would, but for some unforeseen zodiacal altercation
which threw the signs into confusion—I now offer it to you.
And I beg to inform you that if you want cabalistic information upon any
subject: to know the railway likeliest to pay, the definite intentions of
the Prime Minister, the duration of the Income-tax, the fortune or expectations
of any young lady you may meet at a party, or the winner of
the next Derby—the fee of five sovereigns, enclosed to our Prophet at
the publisher's, will ensure an answer by the return of post; containing,
in addition to all he knows upon the subject, a great deal more that he does
not. My limits forbid further observations; but keep these remarks in mind,
and look out for the fulfilment of what is to happen in</p>

<h4 class='c017'>JANUARY.</h4>

<p class='c008'>A frost of some duration will cover the twelfth-cakes of the metropolis at
the commencement of the month, which will begin to be broken up about
Twelfth Night. About the middle of the month the Humane Society will
give a grand dinner, on their retirement from public life, to the Wood Pavement
Company, in gratitude to the latter for offering superior attraction to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>skaters, and taking all accidents off their hands. The Serpentine Receiving-house
will be moved to the Strand in consequence; and the Mile End Omnibuses
will furnish the drags. Several diverting little surprises will happen
in families, by the delivery of bills, which they are either "certain they paid
at the time," or "don't believe they ever owed;" but, unfortunately, being
unable to produce the receipts, will be brutally compelled to pay them
again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Great excitement in the literary world, and especially in the magazines;
which, to give an air of novelty to the new year, will contain twenty continuous
stories each. Fearful vision of the individual who reads them all;
in which he will see the Robertses on their Travels, stopped by St. Giles;
whilst St. James is gone, with Cæsar Borgia, to pay a visit to the Marchioness
of Brinvilliers, and condole with her on the death of Marston, who has been
shot by Rowcroft's Bushranger, now under the care of the Gaol Chaplain,
whose "Revelations of London" have no effect upon him. And the weekly
press aiding this complexity, by representing Mrs. Caudle quarrelling with
Joe Miller for Rodwell's Umbrella which the Wandering Jew gave to his
Stepmother—the nightmare of the unhappy magazine reader will be terrible
indeed!</p>

<p class='c000'>Much discord will prevail in town by reason of nocturnal bands of disturbers
of the public peace, called the Waits, who will play "Then you'll remember
me" for one hour continuously under your window; and call a few
days afterwards, to prove the truth of their musical assertion. The juries for
putting down "false weights," have no power over the measures of these
ruthless marauders.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>A Bad Railway Accident</span> will happen, from a collision of two trains.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>FEBRUARY.</h4>

<p class='c008'>Parliament will meet at the usual time, when the Refuge for the Destitute
in Playhouse Yard will be turned into an asylum for the houseless peers; the
unroofed rooms and heavy rains and floods turning the intended House of
Lords into a Peerless Pool. The enclosure of the Commons will be at the
same time a great question of doubt.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following events will be found this month, without fail, in the papers:—A
dreadful fire in America, and another at Smyrna; a steam-boat explosion
on the Mississippi; an abortive poor-law inquiry in a Midland county;
a terrible inundation somewhere abroad; and the discovery of a railway
swindle in London; which will give rise to a grand <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">battue</span></i> of "stags,"
directed by the <em>Siva</em>, or destroying engine of the "Times."</p>

<p class='c000'>A new line of railway, direct to Windsor, will be sanctioned the earliest in
the Session; in consequence, those who make a pilgrim's progress to the old
station will find it literally the Slough of Despond.</p>

<p class='c000'>A bold member, moving that the statues for the new Senate of the sovereigns
of England shall go up by order of merit rather than succession, will
secure a tolerably good perch for Oliver Cromwell; and it is not unlikely
that Byron's statue will take its place in Poet's Corner at the same time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two new steamers, the <em>Emmet</em> and the <em>Earwig</em>, will run between London
Bridge and Chelsea six times for a penny. They will be greatly crowded in
consequence.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Serious Railway Accident.</span>—A train will get off the line and run down
an embankment into a farm-yard.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>MARCH.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Several legal gentlemen will be expelled from one mess to get into another,
for reporting cases; a plain statement of facts of any kind being against all
professional morality. The press will, in consequence, turn round upon the
bar; and the bar will get pretty considerably the worst of it. The inscription,
"Tongues sold here," will be transferred from ham and beef shops to
the chambers of honourable barristers. Such reform will be worked that a
leading advocate will, perhaps, hang himself upon finding he has undertaken
a wrong cause. The "Andover Commission" will be revived as the "Underhand
Inquiry."</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_206a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Von Lumley will arrive from the Continent with a variety of singing birds,
who will pipe Norma, Puritani, Don Giovanni, duets, arias, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Terrible Railway Accident.</span>—A train going too fast will run over another
going too slow, from neglect of signals.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>APRIL.</h4>

<p class='c008'>The Shakspeare Jubilee Festival will be celebrated at the "only national
theatre" on the 23rd, with the following performances:—</p>

<p class='c000'>"The Grand Opera of '<span class='sc'>Hamlet</span>:' the Music by Mr. Balfe; the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">libretto</span></i> by
Messrs. Shakspeare and Bunn.</p>

<p class='c000'>"After which, a Divertissement; in which Mr. Delferier and Madame
Giubelei will, as Romeo and Juliet, dance the Capulet Polka. Grotesque
Pas de Caliban, from the '<span class='sc'>Tempest</span>,' by Mr. Wieland; and the celebrated
Desperate Combat from '<span class='sc'>Richard the Third</span>,' by Messrs. T. Matthews
and W. H. Payne.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>"The whole to conclude with a New Grand Pantomime of '<span class='sc'>Harlequin
Macbeth; or, the Magic Caldron and Walking Wood</span>.'"</p>

<p class='c000'>From the Opera, the following song may be predicted to be sung by the

<p class='c000'>Arrangements will be made for the characters to promenade in the day,

beef-eater's dresses. The pageant will be very splendid.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>A Terrible Railway Accident</span> will happen, from the engine running up

<h4 class='c017'>MAY.</h4>

<p class='c008'>Several young ladies will now receive
bouquets on the mornings of parties, without
having the "slightest idea" from whom they
come. Human glow-worms will appear hovering
at night, with lanterns, round door-steps
and scrapers, until the Polkas commence;
when the street-doors in the newly-built
houses will take to knocking themselves. A
new musical court of justice will condemn offending
professors to eight hours at the quadrille piano, instead
of so many days at the treadmill. A hapless
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pianiste</span></i> will be found dead at the instrument, at a
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">réunion</span></i> in Eaton Square, after the "after-supper
cotillion."</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_207c.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Several grand morning concerts will take place at
the Opera Concert Room, in which every <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">artiste</span></i> in
London will sing or play twice. They will commence
at two <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, and always conclude in time for breakfast
the next morning. An elegant little article
will be invented, called "The Nutritive Lozenge; or, Concert Portable
Larder," to support the existence of those who <em>will</em> wait the programme
out. Arrangements will be made with some machinery from the stage
for hauling those who faint or die through the windows on to the top of the
colonnade, without disturbing the rest of the audience.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span><span class='sc'>Dreadful Railway Accident</span>, from the bursting of a boiler, which will
blow everybody and everything into an impalpable powder. The steam will
cook a number of greens in an adjacent field, and boil a number of pigs;
providing a choice meal for a number of residents in an adjacent union, who
will be turned out to feed for the day.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>JUNE.</h4>

<p class='c008'>Ascot and Epsom races will take place. Several pigeons will be let off
after each race; but other pigeons will not be let off so easily on the Tuesday
following. Gentlemen, on their way home, who have ventured to back
unruly horses, will find themselves either "hedging," or "taking the field"
the other side of it. The confusion on the road will be a literal case of wheels-within-wheels,
and jibbers will convert all the carriages into breaks. The road
home, covered with ruined poles; and the police cannot order them to move
on. The rain at Ascot will become the first defaulter, and refuse to "down
with the dust;" so that the "Heath's Beauties" will all look as if prepared
for a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bal poudré</span></i>. All the vehicles will get inextricably locked together at
Sutton; and the passengers, not knowing what to do, will all play different
tunes upon their cornets and post-horns, illustrating the horns of a dilemma.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the end of the month a thunderstorm will, by its electric fluid, create
the greatest disturbance on the telegraph wires of the Southampton Railway,
catching and distorting some messages as they pass, during a telegraphic
game of chess, and other proceedings. The clerk at the Gosport end will be
utterly bewildered thereat, being ordered to "checkmate the Kingston station
with the Queen's luggage-bishop."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Shocking Railway Accident.</span>—A man, lying across the rails asleep, a
favourite position, will be cut in half, and his superior portion carried down
to Bristol—the inferior remaining at Slough. Parochial quarrel, as to the
inquest, in consequence.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>JULY.</h4>

<p class='c008'>Opening of Vauxhall Gardens once more, positively for the last time, upon
temperance principles. Festivals of St. Swithin and Father Mathew held on
the grounds, with appropriate devices in real rain-water. Patent taken out for
the "Vauxhall Illumination Lamp," consisting of the addition of a small
parasol to each lamp. Vauxhall weather-houses sold at the toy-shops.—N.B.
When Widdicombe comes out it will be wet. Mr. Green, finding balloons
cease to attract, having successively tried a night ascent, a lady with her
leopard, a gentleman with his tiger, &amp;c., volunteers to go up on a skyrocket,
and come down with an umbrella, instead of a parachute. He will be taken
before the Lord Mayor, on his descent, for attempting self-destruction.</p>

<p class='c000'>The night before the close of the Midsummer holidays an immense number
of little boys and girls will be attacked with alarming signs of indisposition,
but on being kept at home will rapidly recover.</p>

<p class='c000'>The blocks of Wenham ice in the Strand shop-window will melt very
quickly—the only American affair that looks at all clear, or is liquidated
spontaneously, or (as sherry cobbler) worth a straw.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Very Alarming Railway Accident.</span>—An engine getting off the line,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>will carry the train through a gentleman's country house, where he is entertaining
some friends.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_209.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />

<h4 class='c017'>AUGUST.</h4>

<p class='c008'>The Queen, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en voyage</span></i>, accompanied by Prince Albert, will pay a visit to
Calcutta, by the overland route, and come home by St. Petersburgh; starting,
immediately on her return, for Ireland, and thence to New York: the whole
being accomplished within the month. Great confusion in the houses of the
nobility she unexpectedly looks in upon—begging of extra servants, borrowing
of plate, and stealing of evergreens. The illustrated papers for the week contain
their thirty engravings as usual, and they are all triumphal arches.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several shooting stars will be visible in the northern district about the
twelfth. Sultry weather: and the Wenham Lake ice has all melted. <em>Ne
sutor ultra crepidam</em>—no more sherry cobbler after the last.</p>

<p class='c000'>M. Jullien will give a Concert Monstre, and introduce his Leviathan
Ophicleide, prepared for the country festivals, and containing living, cooking,
and sleeping conveniences for his entire orchestra.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Horrible Railway Accident.</span>—An express train will leap over the wall
of a viaduct, when those who expected to "go down" by it will not be
disappointed.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>SEPTEMBER</h4>

<p class='c008'>The Annual Blockade, or Great Plague of London, by the Commissioners
of Sewers and Improvements, will take place this month. The nearest way
from St. Paul's to Temple Bar will be through Farringdon Street, Smithfield,
across Gray's Inn Lane, Theobald's Road (Holborn is also closed), Red Lion
Square, Queen Street, and Drury Lane. Endless rows with cabmen in consequence,
who object to eightpence for the distance. General emigration of
the British, who will be found everywhere, in the language of the month, in
large coveys, strong on the wing, and offering excellent sport to foreigners.
It is probable that the last man about town will commit suicide in the centre
of Leicester Square; to explore which hitherto unknown locality an expedition
will be fitted out, now that the new street has opened a facility of
communication with the interior.</p>

<p class='c000'>The stars portend the ultimate death of Bartholomew Fair, Esquire, after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>several years of wasting decline, the result of injuries received some time ago
from the corporation of London. He will lie in state in Smithfield for three
days, on a handsome bier of gilt gingerbread, and under a canopy of show-canvas,
with incense burning round him from altars of sausage-stoves. The
Black Wild Indian, the Fair Circassian, the Yorkshire Giant, the Welsh
Dwarf, the Fat Boy, the Living Skeleton, and the Ghost from Richardson's,
will in turn act as mourners.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Annoying Railway Accident.</span>—The train will break down in the middle
of a two-mile tunnel, and will not be discovered until pushed out by the next.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OCTOBER.</h4>

<p class='c008'>Several fires will break out in and about London, but, as they will be
principally confined to their proper places, no ill-effects will happen, except
in the cases where the servants will neglect to open the chimney-boards, and
emancipate the blacks. About this period we may look for the reappearance
of several muffs and boas from their summer hiding-places.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rain may be expected about the 4th, 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 30th of this month.
I say it may be expected, but this does not follow that it will come. If it does
not, it will fall at some other time, or probably not at all; but the reader may
rely upon one or the other of these meteorological phenomena taking place.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>A Singular Railway Accident</span> will happen from using two engines,
one before and the other behind; which, not acting together, will crumple
the train up between them, like the back of an insulted cat. The tender
will vindicate its claim to its title by being crushed to pieces.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>NOVEMBER.</h4>

<p class='c008'>A dense fog—an English festival of "St. Cloud"—will visit the metropolis;
during the continuance of which several blunders will be made by the
Londoners which would not otherwise have occurred. A celebrated literary
hydropathist will be mistaken for a pump of hard water, until he is run
against and found to be soft. The Penitentiary will be taken for a poor-law
union; the National Gallery for a railway station; and St Paul's and Westminster
Abbey for two religious peep-shows: but Covent Garden Theatre will
not be taken for anything by anybody.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Ludicrous Railway Accident.</span>—The fastenings of a carriage will come
undone and the train will speed on to the terminus, whilst the travellers
behind are left half-way in the midst of a flooded cutting.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>DECEMBER.</h4>

<p class='c008'>The Young England party will be decidedly in the ascendant at the commencement
of the holidays; and materially affect "the social condition of
the people" in the house.</p>

<p class='c000'>Popular lectures on "cold," at the Polytechnic Institution, when the Professor
will have the subject at his fingers' ends. Dr. Ryan, having frozen
water in a red-hot crucible, will next make a piece of ice red-hot without
melting it, by reversing the process.</p>

<p class='c000'>The march of intellect will be found to have altered all the old Christmas
objects of revelry. The yule log will be supplanted by an Arnott's stove;
the homely carol, by an Italian scena, which the singer does not understand;
the wassail bowl, by British brandy, or perhaps something better; and the
mummers, by the far more dangerous false masks and manners of society, as
at present constituted.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Tremendous Railway Accident.</span>—Four trains will meet at a cross
junction line exactly at the same time. Every precaution will be taken to
avoid danger, as soon as the accident has occurred.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>"SAY YOU DID IT!"<br /> A ROMANCE OF SMILES AND TITTERS.<br /> TITTER THE FIRST.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>That ordinary-looking middle-aged gentleman, who is just emerging from that
Jeweller's shop, is Signor Goffoni. He has been there to purchase a pair of earrings
for his pretty young wife, with which he purposes to bribe her into good-humour
with him again. For, to say the truth, the happy couple have lately been
living on the usual matrimonial terms which follow the union of Signoras, who
are scarcely out of their teens, with Signors, who are half way through their 'tys.
And this morning the conjugal breezes had swollen into a perfect hymeneal
hurricane. It had blown divorces and separate maintenances. The Signora had
gone into the customary hysterics, and the Signor had left the house with that
violent bang of the street-door which is the especial property of enraged husbands.
And "the cause—the cause" was precisely the same as made Mr. Othello determine
to put an extinguisher upon his better-half, instead of his night-lamp. The
green-eyed monster had kittened his horrid suspicions in Signor Goffoni's bosom,
and had lapped up all the milk of human kindness in the dairy of his heart. He
had accidentally discovered a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">billet</span></i>—something more than a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">doux</span></i>—addressed to
his black-eyed young wife, from a gentleman calling himself the Marchese di
Castellinaria, and which expressed a regard for her that—tested by the very delicate
thermometer of the Signor's jealousy—did appear to him not quite so tepid
as mere friendship would dictate. And he had not scrupled to say as much to
the black eyes he had taken for better or for worse. Whereupon the said ebon
optics had looked scissors, though they'd used none—had vowed eternal separation—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">usque
ad mensam et torum</span></i>—and wound up with those effective convulsions of
which married ladies generally keep a plentiful supply, ready for use. Jealousy,
however, had galvanized the iron of the Signor's heart, and made it no longer
susceptible of being acted upon by the salt water of his wife's eyes; so, as we said
before, he bounced out of the house with a bang like a human cracker.</p>

<p class='c000'>Long before evening, however, Goffoni had relented; he felt convinced that he
had wronged his dear little wife by his unjust suspicions, and arrived at the sage
conclusion that he was a brute and she was an angel; so that an hour before his
usual time for quitting business he hurried off to the nearest Jeweller's to buy her
a pair of earrings, determined to hasten home and shed over her the diamond
drops of repentance. But on arriving at his domicile, he found the dark-eyed
young partner of his bosom absent from home. Could his unkind treatment have
driven her from his roof? The very thought was stilettoes. He rang furiously
and inquired of the servant concerning her mistress. She had quitted the house
about half an hour ago, leaving directions that the letter which the maid then
presented should be delivered to the Signor immediately on his return. He
seized it. It was unaddressed, and ran as follows:—</p>

<p class='c021'>"After your insulting conduct I can no longer consent to the continuance of
our acquaintance. I must beg, therefore, that henceforth we be as Strangers;
and that you will never again dare to offend me with the protestation of your
regard, which it is utterly impossible for me further to acknowledge.</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"<span class='sc'>Carlotta.</span>"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>"Gone! gone!" groaned Goffoni; and he sunk overwhelmed upon the sofa,
and buried his face in his hands. Presently he started up again—buttoned his
coat vehemently—knocked his hat on his head—and dashed from the house with
a wild look of despair and prussic acid.</p>

<p class='c000'>That miserable-looking middle-aged gentleman, seated on that stone in the
heart of that wood, is Signor Goffoni. And that small phial, which he takes from
his waistcoat-pocket, is labelled "<span class='sc'>Laudanum</span>!" He has sought out this secluded
spot, and purchased this poisonous potion, to put a premature "finis" to his
wretched biography. For "what is the world now to him?" he says—"a wilderness—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>desert. He has lost the angel who made it a paradise; and as he always
felt convinced that there was not another woman like her upon earth, why should
he go dawdling on alone to the grave? No! he is resolved! Bereft of his Carlotta,
he cares not to live, and fears not to die. She has bidden adieu to him, so
he will bid adieu to the world."</p>

<p class='c000'>With this brief oration the woe-begone Goffoni drew the stopper from the
phial, and swallowed its contents.</p>

<p class='c000'>No sooner had he drunk off the deadly draught than a Signor, habited in a
capacious cloak, started up from behind the stone on which Goffoni was seated,
and inquired whether he would save the life of a fellow-creature?</p>

<p class='c000'>"I save the life of a fellow-creature!" gasped Goffoni, dropping the empty phial
with amazement from his hand; "I am a dying man myself!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes! I know that," replied the Signor in the cloak, "and that is the cause of
my making the request. The fact is, the other gentleman, whose life is in danger,
is not quite so tired of his existence as you seem to be of yours. And since you
are determined on going out of the world, you may as well leave it with the grace
of a good action, and let your death be the salvation of his life."</p>

<p class='c000'>Goffoni, who was now ready to clutch at any straw that appeared likely to
save him from sinking in the next world, simply asked, "How that could be?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, never mind about that," returned he in the cloak; "only you consent to
do it, and I'll soon tell you how. Come! what do you say? Recollect 'charity
covers a multitude of sins,' and you've got a pretty good lot here to answer for,
certainly."</p>

<p class='c000'>Goffoni felt that he had, and being anxious now to obtain absolution by any
means, he, not very reluctantly, promised to do what the stranger desired.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whereupon the Signor in the cloak informed Goffoni that, finding himself rather
short of cash, he had requested the loan of some gold from a drover whom he had
met that evening in the forest; but that the drover had not only in the most un-gentleman-like
manner refused to accommodate him, but had even been base enough
to doubt the honesty of his intentions. That this had so exasperated him in the
cloak that he had knocked the scoundrel down, and borrowed of him all the
money he possessed. That the cries of the drover had brought the soldiers to his
assistance, when the Signor in the cloak was obliged to run for his life; but that
in his flight he had dropped his hat on the road. That he had only just succeeded
in avoiding his pursuers by secreting himself behind that stone, when Signor
Goffoni had come up and seated himself upon it. "However," added he, "the
soldiers can't be far off; and when they find I've given them the slip they will be
certain to return, for I know them of old. So that, you see, what I want of you
now, my friend, is, should the rogues come this way again, and question you about
that nonsensical piece of business, that you'll just have the kindness—since it can't
make any difference to you in your present situation—to say you did it."</p>

<p class='c000'>Goffoni, when he heard what was required of him, hardly liked the office he had
undertaken to perform. But as it certainly could not make any difference to him
in his present situation, and as he had given his promise, he told the gentleman in
the cloak he would be as good as his word and say he did it. The stranger
thanked Goffoni heartily, called him his preserver, and many other equally complimentary
names, and was about hurrying off, when a sudden thought detained
him, "Stay!" he exclaimed, "this cloak will make your confession all the more
veritable, while the possession of the identical purse I took from that rascally
drover will put the affair beyond the shadow of a suspicion." And so saying, he
threw the one hastily over the back of Goffoni, and, having divested the other of
its contents, slipped the empty leathern bag into the
breeches-pocket of that poor
gentleman, who, by this time, lay writhing on his stomach, under the painful
effects of the deadly draught he had swallowed.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And now once more, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Addio</span>!" exclaimed the stranger, putting on the hat of
Signor G. as a substitute for the one he had dropped on the road; "and mind!" he
added, "I rely upon you to—say you did it!"</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>The sound of the stranger's retiring footsteps had scarcely died upon the ear,
when, as he had predicted, the soldiers came up, led by the drover, of whom the
late proprietor of the Mantello had spoken.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I tell you it's hereabouts I missed him," said the owner of the lost purse.
"And <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">ecco</span>!" he exclaimed, as his eyes fell on the prostrate figure of Goffoni, enveloped
in the cloak, "by all the Saints! here lies the rascal, shamming asleep,
too, as I live!"</p>

<p class='c000'>The sleep, however, was no make-believe on the part of poor Goffoni, who,
under the growing influence of the opiate, was rapidly sinking into the joint
embraces of Messrs. Morpheus and Mors, and had just commenced nodding off—to
Death.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Come, get up here!" shouted one of the soldiers, giving Goffoni a kick that
even in his drowsy state had the effect of making him open his eyes. "Get up, I
say! We want you about a little bit of highway robbery that you've been having
a finger in this evening—do you hear?" And the military querist punctuated
the ribs of the wretched Signor with a heavy note of interrogation from his regulation
boot.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, I hear!" replied the agonized Goffoni; "I know! a highway robbery! I
did it! I did it!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Mark that, gentlemen!" said the drover to the soldiers. "The fellow confesses
he did it; mark that!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, you did it, did you?" said the soldier. "Come, then, you must go with
us. So quick! stir yourself, I say." And again the regulation-boot hammered
away at the sides of the unfortunate Goffoni.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Do let me die here, <em>do</em>!" implored the moribund Signor G.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Die here!" returned the man of war. "No, no! you'll have to die in a rather
more public place than this, I'm thinking. But come! we're not going to be
played the fool with in this manner. Get up, I tell you once more!" So saying,
the soldier took the prostrate Signor by the collar and set him on his legs.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh! why <em>wont</em> you let me be quiet?" groaned Goffoni; "I've taken poison—indeed
I have!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Taken poison!" the soldier exclaimed, with a sneer; "taken a purse, you
mean, and it will prove just as fatal to you, I'll be sworn. However, we're not to
be gulled by any such flams, don't think it. So let's see what you've got in your
pockets. Oh! a pair of diamond earrings, eh? Very pretty indeed! the produce
of some other robbery, no doubt! A gold watch, and ditto snuff-box! Equally
honestly come by, I'll wager. A good stroke of business you've been doing this
evening, my man! And here's a silk purse, with lots of money in it; and here's
a leathern one without a soldo."</p>

<p class='c000'>"The leathern one's mine!" cried the drover; "but it was full when the
scoundrel took it from me."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Of course it was! and the rogue's emptied the contents of the one into the
other. But that don't matter—the mere finding of the purse upon him is quite
enough to take the breath out of his body. So, come! give over this shamming,"
continued the soldier, violently shaking the drowsy Signor, who was again nodding
under the somnorific effects of the laudanum. "We're too old birds to be
caught by such chaff as this, I can tell you. So on to prison with you—get on."</p>

<p class='c000'>Whereupon two of the soldiers placed themselves, one on either side of the ill-fated
Goffoni, and commenced dragging him by the collar to the Casa di Correzione,
while the two others attended him in the rear, and by the aid of their
bayonets, applied to that part of his person where a gentleman's honour is supposed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>to reside, kept continually dissipating the incipient slumbers of the somnolent
Signor, and goading him like an untractable donkey on to the nearest house
of entertainment for brigands and patriots.</p>

<hr class='c019' />

<p class='c000'>The bayonets of the soldiers were so efficacious in counteracting the somniferous
tendency of the opiate which Signor Goffoni had swallowed, that by the time he
had reached the gates of the Casa di Correzione, a distance of at least five miles
from the scene of his capture, the exercise had done him so much good that it had
"worked off" all his drowsiness, and he was, the morning after, in the most
miserable state of perfect convalescence.</p>

<p class='c000'>Goffoni instantly began protesting his innocence; but the incredulous jailor
assured him it was to no purpose, and that he might look upon himself as a dead
man; for that his own confession, let alone the circumstantial evidence, was
quite enough to settle his business.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wretched Signor called himself a fool, an idiot, a jackass, a nincompoop,
and a volume of other titles equally complimentary to his intellect, for ever having
consented to take another man's crime upon himself—as he pledged his honour to
the jailor he had done in the present instance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The jailor, however, was a man of too great experience to place much faith in
the honour of gentlemen charged with highway robbery. And so to the Signor's
asseveration, he replied with a knowing wink—"Gammon! Well, I've heard
many lame defences in my time, but, hang me! if that isn't the most rickety
concern I ever listened to. I should like to know the judge," he continued, "that
you think would swallow such indigestible stuff as that. For everyone is aware
that gentlemen in your line of business an't quite such born donkeys as to take
other men's sins upon their shoulders, when they've always got a pretty tidy load
of their own. So if you follow my advice, my man," considerately added the
jailor, "you'll plead guilty like a Christian, and then, perhaps, you may be lucky
enough to get off with the galleys for life."</p>

<p class='c000'>Goffoni, however, finding his declarations of innocence made no impression upon
the officers of justice, determined at length upon seeking the advice and consolation
of some counsel learned in the chicanery of the law. But the Gentleman in
Black afforded him little comfort; for though he himself, he said, had no doubt of
the truth of the Signor's strange statement, still, he thought that Goffoni would
find it extremely difficult to make a court of justice believe that human stupidity
could go to such lengths. And he was afraid that his unfortunate client must
make up his mind to the worst; for that, of late, the robberies in the neighbourhood
had so much increased that the authorities had resolved to make an example
of the very next culprit.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whereupon Goffoni again declared that he was a fool, an idiot, &amp;c., for ever
having consented to stand as godfather to a foot-pad, and take the transgressions
of a gentleman with a passion for highway robbery, upon himself. And he tore
his toupée and he thumped his cranium, as though he were trying to cudgel his
brains for allowing him to—say he did it.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Goffoni, however, though he hardly relished the idea of bidding adieu to the
world, and a generous Italian public, on the boards of a scaffold—and which he
now felt there was something stronger than a mere probability of his doing—at
length began to contemplate his lot with all the melodramatic magnanimity of
injured innocence. And though he had but little of the martyr in his constitution,
yet as Fate had cast him the part, he was determined to fudge up as much
stoical sternness as his nature would allow him to throw into the character. Besides,
deserted by his Carlotta, he had still no great desire to continue a solitary
unit on the slate of creation; so that, to use his own expression, it mattered not
when he was sponged out. "What was the world to him?" again he asked himself,
and again he gave himself precisely the same answer, videlicet,—"a wilderness,
a desert!" Existence, he said, he viewed as a piece of burnt rag, with but
a few bright specks flitting across its dark surface; and he cared not how soon
"the parson and the clerk" appeared to announce the departure of his vital spark.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Goffoni had no sooner made up his mind to play the unmitigated hero to
the last, than the presence of her whose absence had given him such supernatural
fortitude thawed all the artificial ice of his stoicism, and made the hero melt into
the man.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yes! the dark-eyed young partner of his bosom and four-poster—she whom he
believed had left him for ever for the Marchese di Castellinaria, had come to console
him in his affliction! and Goffoni, though he could have been a Regulus
without his Carlotta, felt, when he saw her, all his magnanimity ooze out of his eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh! Bartolo! Bartolo!" sobbed the Signora, "if I hadn't seen it in all the
papers I should never have dreamt of finding you here. You can't tell what I've
suffered on your account!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh! Carlotta! Carlotta!" groaned Goffoni: "and what have <em>I</em> not suffered on
<em>your</em> account? But for <em>you</em>, alas! I should not have been here."</p>

<p class='c000'>"For me-e!" hysterically exclaimed Carlotta. "Oh! don't say so! How could
<em>I</em> possibly have anything to do with it?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Didn't you tell me," inquired the woe-begone Signor, "that you'd leave me—<em>for
ever</em>? You did! You know you did!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes! but I'd done so a hundred times before," retorted Mrs. Goffoni; "and
I thought you knew women better than to believe such things."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nor should I have been such a booby as to do so," remarked Mr. G., "if you
hadn't written me that horrid letter."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Letter!" cried Carlotta. "Oh! I see it all now! I do! That letter was intended
for the Marchese di Castellinaria, and you—you—wretched—stupid man—you
thought it was meant for yourself."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Intended for that cursed Marchese!" shouted Signor Goffoni. "Then why the
deuce did you leave the house, and tell the maid to give it to me?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh! I thought it would make you so happy and comfortable!" exclaimed his
miserable little wife. "I thought it would please you so on your return home to
find how I'd answered the fellow's impertinent note."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then! oh dear! oh dear!" replied Goffoni; "why <em>couldn't</em> you have shown
it to me yourself?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why, because you were so cruel, and so put out about that note in the morning,
that I didn't like to see you again until I had made you acquainted with
what I had done. So I left the copy for you to read, while I went out to post the
original."</p>

<p class='c000'>Goffoni now saw through the mistake as clearly as his better half; and again
he railed at the limited extent of his intellectual faculties, applying to himself the
same complimentary terms as he had previously used. And then he kissed his
Carlotta, and called her his own blessed angel of a wife, and himself her own
cursed fool of a husband; and gave vent to his feelings—which were now a kind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>of a piebald of grief and joy—in a manner that makes a bankrupt of description,
and forces history to take the benefit of the insolvent act. For he plainly perceived
that, without any real cause, he had taken poison and a highway robbery
upon himself; and that he would be forced to separate from his Carlotta at a
time when he had no desire to leave her, and by a species of divorce for which he
had now lost all relish.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sorry Signor then recited to his wondering little wife the tale which we
have before told the reader (only not quite so cleverly as ourselves); and on
showing her the cloak that he had received from the stranger, his distress of mind
was in no way relieved by hearing his Carlotta—who could swear to the clasp
and collar—peremptorily pronounce it to be the property of the very Marchese
from whom he dated all his troubles. So that he now saw, in addition to his
miseries, not only that he had saved the life of him who was the primary cause of
all his jealousy, but that he was about to die outright for the crimes of the very
man whose peccadilloes had nearly put an end to his existence by poison before.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yes! facetious reader, it was even so! The Signora's gallant Marchese was
none other than the Signor's ungallant stranger, a gentleman better known in the
romance of highway robbery as <span class='sc'>Virtuoso</span>, the brigand! and who, in the glowing
language of one of the many instructive novels, of which he afterwards became
the hero, "was no vulgar Freebooter." No! his was a spirit too proud to beg,
too chivalrous to work, and too generous to trade. If he took from the rich he
freely gave to the poor; and if, in the pursuance of his romantic vocation, he was
compelled, in self-defence, to sacrifice the life of some obstinate victim, he ever
after endeavoured to remove the stain of the blood from his soul by the scouring
drops of contrition. Nor was his love of the poor greater than his love of—<span class='sc'>Woman</span>!
To her his lustrous eye and soft guitar-like voice, coupled with the
perils of his adventurous life, had ever a magical charm. He was not merely the
Freebooter of Lucre, but—the Brigand of the Heart! And if his passion was of
too fickle and roving a nature, at least in extenuation it may be pleaded that he
never parted from the object of his love without first abstracting from her some
article of jewellery or plate, by which to treasure up her remembrance.</p>

<p class='c000'>However, to return to poor Goffoni. The day of his trial at length arrived. On
being placed in the dock it seemed to him as if he were standing on the doorstep
of Eternity; for reflection and everybody had conspired to assure him of the utter
hopelessness of his case. And when, to his infinite horror, he heard the drover,
without the least hesitation, swear that he, the Signor, was the man who had
taken his purse, Goffoni felt as though his shoulders had already served his head
with notice to quit. The judge, however, finding that the case turned on a point
of disputed identity, ordered the prisoner to put on the hat which had been
dropped on the road. Goffoni did so, and was suffused with a cold perspiration
on finding that it fitted him to a hair. He was then directed to endorse his body
with the cloak, which, alas! also suited the poor devil as though it had been made
to measure. The drover looked at him for a second, and then swore with even
greater certainty than before that he was the identical person who had robbed
him. Goffoni now saw that the sands of his last moments were fast running
through the egg-boiler of his existence, when—as the gentlemen of the Italian
press afterwards expressed it—"a stranger, dressed in the first style of fashion,
rose from the body of the court, and requested to be permitted to put on the
articles in which the prisoner had just appeared." Having obtained the sanction
of the judge, he attired himself in the cloak and hat, and demanded of the drover,
on his oath, whether he, the stranger, was not the party who had taken his purse?
The drover eyed the stranger from top to toe, and then, after a little deliberation,
swore even still more emphatically that he was. Whereupon the stranger pointed
out to the judge that since the drover had sworn with equal certainty to two
different parties as the culprit, it was clear that he might be mistaken in both.</p>

<p class='c000'>A word to the wise is sufficient. So, reader, if your skull be not as thick as a
bombshell, it is hardly necessary for us to tell you that Goffoni was acquitted—that
it was Virtuoso, the brigand, who procured his acquittal; and that the Moral
of all this is (for we must be "moral to the last"), never take the good or bad action
of another to yourself, nor be shabby or silly enough to—"<span class='fss'>SAY YOU DID IT</span>."</p>

      <div class='line in2'>Now he'd applied, and—what was better—</div>
      <div class='line'>This Stag had just receiv'd a letter,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>But soon to this fam'd cervine quarter</div>
      <div class='line'>There came a Bull intent on slaughter,</div>
      <div class='line'>And finding that the Stag I tell of</div>

      <div class='line'>The Bull began to run them down,</div>

      <div class='line'>And thus—these Bulls have so much art with 'em—</div>
      <div class='line'>At last he got the Stag to part with 'em.</div>
      <div class='line'>For 'tis with these same Bulls on 'Change</div>

      <div class='line'>To both alike this rule applies,</div>

      <div class='line'>He vow'd the Bull had sorely treated him,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nay—more he'd say—the Bull had cheated him.</div>
      <div class='line'>It was the noblest of all schemes,</div>
      <div class='line'>This Junction of St. Giles and <em>Jeames</em>!</div>
      <div class='line'>However, as he hated knavery,</div>
      <div class='line'>To do him an especial favour, he</div>
      <div class='line'>Would let the Stag have thirty more,</div>
      <div class='line'>At what he sold the others for;</div>
      <div class='line'>The Stag of gratitude discourséd,</div>
      <div class='line'>And took 'em on the terms aforesaid.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Now all this kindness of the Bear</div>
      <div class='line'>Was nothing but a "<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ruse-de-guerre</span></i>;"</div>
      <div class='line'>For no one knew so well as Bruin</div>
      <div class='line'>To hold the Shares was perfect ruin;</div>
      <div class='line'>The whole affair was but a swindle,</div>
      <div class='line'>And down to discount soon would dwindle.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And, truth to say, the Bear was right,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Panic came, like Lillywhite,</div>
      <div class='line'>That terror of the Lords, and bowl'd out</div>
      <div class='line'>Ev'ry man Jack who hadn't sold out;</div>
      <div class='line'>So that there was on "settling day,"</div>
      <div class='line'>The Devil and the Bear to pay.</div>
      <div class='line'>"But," says the Stag, "that cunning buffer,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Bull, will be the chap to suffer;</div>
      <div class='line'>So in a cab to him I'll dash up,</div>
      <div class='line'>And get my taurine friend to cash up."</div>
      <div class='line'>But when he gets to Mr. Taurus's,</div>
      <div class='line'>Pasted upon the outer door, he sees</div>
      <div class='line'>A card with these words written over,</div>
      <div class='line'>"<span class='sc'>Gone to Boulogne</span> <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viâ</span></i> <span class='sc'>Dover</span>."</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Now as the Bull had run away,</div>
      <div class='line'>Unable for the shares to pay,</div>
      <div class='line'>'Twas clear, as he'd no cash to spare,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Stag then couldn't pay the Bear;</div>
      <div class='line'>So when the Bear went for his due,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Stag had gone to Boulogne too.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And, since the Stag had cut and run,</div>
      <div class='line'>'Twas plain the Bear could pay no one;</div>
      <div class='line'>So those to whom he money ow'd,</div>
      <div class='line'>When they sought out the brute's abode,</div>
      <div class='line'>Found that the Bear, or him they call so,</div>
      <div class='line'>Had cut and run to Boulogne also.</div>

<h3 class='c007'>MEETING OF THE DWARFS.</h3>

<p class='c008'>A meeting of the real bipeds, or little human beings who run about upon two
feet, was held at the Lilliputian Warehouse, in New Street, Covent Garden, to
move an address of thanks to Her Majesty, for her liberal patronage of the least
of the Rational Animals.</p>

<p class='c000'>General <span class='sc'>Tom Thumb</span>, L.S.D., was unanimously voted to the Child's Chair,
and the business of the Meeting having been opened by the Small Germans.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The <span class='sc'>General</span> rose—a few inches—to address his brother Homuncules. He
said they had met to offer up an act of gratitude from the
Shortest men to the Highest Personage in the Realm—to
her who had refused to patronize everything great, and had
stooped to take <em>them</em> by the hand—to her who had originally
given them that lift, which had caused them—short as
they were—to be looked up to by—<span class='sc'>Lovely Woman</span>. And
he would be happy to favour the company with "God Save
the Queen," gratis.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <span class='sc'>English Tom Thumb</span> here rose to rebut the
General's assertions, and was proceeding to complain of the
want of patronage offered to native insignificance, when he
was carried out.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <span class='sc'>Highland Dwarfs</span>, in a Scotch accent as broad as
their size would admit, said, "a' the Gen'ral had drapt was
unco' true." When they left the Land o' Cakes they could
hardly raise a Bawbee among them, and now they could put down 1000<em>l.</em> any day.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <span class='sc'>Boshie Men</span>, or <span class='sc'>Pigmy Race</span>, through their interpreter, stated, they
were happy to find that, though the Dwarfs had come over to England little by
little, they now formed so large a body.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Don Francisco Hidalgo</span> said, "Dat as el smallest man in el vorld, he objec

<p class='c000'>The little Men here got to very high words, and the meeting broke up in
confusion.</p>

</div>

<h4 class='c017'>DUAN THE FIRST.</h4>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div><em>Argument.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'><em>This poem is addressed to the Maid of "the</em> <span class='sc'>Rainbow</span>" (<em>in Fleet Street</em>), <em>where</em>
<span class='sc'>Ossian</span> <em>is enjoying his Whisky and Cigar. The</em> <span class='sc'>Phlaruppe</span> <em>here spoken of is
the same as the <span class='sc'>Aquævadius</span> mentioned so frequently in Police History, and who
in the year '40 headed an expedition against the Knockers of</em> <span class='sc'>Cockaigne</span>, <em>and
was repulsed by "the force" under the command of</em> <span class='sc'>Rowan</span>, <em>the chief of Scotland
(Yard), though not until</em> <span class='sc'>Phlaruppe</span> <em>had routed several of his "Divisions." Tradition
assigns the date of this event to the year '42, but on searching the pages of
the historian</em> <span class='sc'>Hodder</span>, <em>we find no mention made of the circumstance in his valuable
work entitled</em>, "<span class='sc'>Sketches of Life and Character taken at Bow Street</span>."</p>

<p class='c000'>Bring, daughter of the Rainbow! bring me the pen of steel! The mountain-dew
sparkles in Ossian's brain, and it is brilliant with song. As is the black reviver
to the garment whose seams are white with age, so is the cream of the valley
to the seedy soul of the bard. It brings back the freshness of youth.</p>

<p class='c000'>A tale of high life! The deeds of the superior classes!</p>

<p class='c000'>The draught of the waters of Kinahan wakens the memory of the past. The
odour of thy weeds, mild Lopez! is pleasant in Ossian's nose. Like the brow of
Ben-Primrose, his head is veiled in clouds. Listen, thou daughter of the Rainbow!
to the deeds of the superior classes.</p>

<p class='c000'>A tale of high life!</p>

<p class='c000'>Fair is thy Garden, O Covent! Green are its paths with the leaves of the cabbage.
There the cauliflower of Fulham rests its white head, and the pine of
Jamaica perfumes the breeze. The daughters of Erin are there laden with Pippins
of gold. Near are the halls of Evans. Music is heard in them by night. The
morning dawns in song. The voice of Llewellyn of Wales gladdens the feast! and
Sloman, the son of Israel, pours forth his numbers, apt as the bard of Moses. Glad
are the halls of Evans! It is the abode of Joy!</p>

<p class='c000'>Wilt thou not listen, bright maid of the Rainbow! to the voice of Ossian? My
soul is bursting with song. The collars of my Corazza droop like the ears of the
Greyhound, and my eye in a fine frenzy rolls. Thus the mighty Bunn appears
when he dreams that he dwells in marble halls. Dost thou not behold, bright maid!
the head of a lion in Ossian's hand? A ring of iron depends from its mouth, and
its face wears a look of rage. That head the noble Phlaruppe, Lord of Belgravia,
tore away. Phlaruppe tore it away by the strength of his arm. Listen,
then, daughter of the Rainbow! to the tale of high life! The deeds of the superior
classes!</p>

<p class='c000'>What sound is that kisses the ear? Across thy Garden, sweet Covent! it comes
dancing along the breeze. Can it be the song of the lark climbing the sky? But
the lark wakes not the night with his notes; and bright burns the gas in the lamp
of the Tavistock. 'Tis the voice of Von Joel, the toothless, gladdening the halls of
Evans. Of Evans, the son of Thespis.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Thespian son sits in his hall of state. The feast is spread around. The
strong waters of Hodges and Betts sparkle on the board. A thousand Havannahs
perfume the air. A thousand glittering tankards foam with the nectar of Barclay.
There is the ripe fruit of Erin, and the rabbit of Wales is there.</p>

<p class='c000'>Who comes from the Saloons of the West, with his warriors around him? He
smokes the Dodeen of peace. His face glows with the juice of the Gooseberry. His
cheeks are as red as the garments of the bearers of letters on the festival of May?
Who is it but the noble Phlaruppe, the Lord of Belgravia? In his train is Sutton
the Sambo; and Burke, the hard of hearing, attends him. Mighty in battle are
they.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Lord of Belgravia graces the board: the Bards hail his presence with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>song. He quaffs the brown stout of Dublin. The night reels away in revelry.
The morning peeps in at the casement; and Phlaruppe, the Lord of Belgravia, is
glorious with Guinness's.</p>

<p class='c000'>A tale of high life! The deeds of the superior classes!</p>

<h4 class='c017'>DUAN THE SECOND.</h4>

<p class='c008'>Grey grows the air with the Day's young light. With the carmine of Morning
the cheek of Heaven is rouged. The Camphine lamp of the Moon has gone out;
and turned off is the Gas of the Stars. Yawning the tired Policeman crawls on
his rounds.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hushed are the halls of Evans.</p>

<p class='c000'>Where art thou, Belgravia's Lord? Thou pride of the West, where art thou?
Lo! he comes; but his steps are unsteady with Beer. On the sinewy arms of the
dark-skinned Sutton, and Burke, surnamed the Deaf, he leans. From them he
bursts of a sudden, like the cork from the Waters of Soda. The head of a lion on
the gates of Gliddon, the chief of the Divan, frowns on the valiant Phlaruppe.
Dauntless as the brute-taming Van Amburgh, he grapples with the iron beast.
He sounds the "fake away" of Belgravia. One potent wrench of his arm and the
head of the forest king hangs drooping from Phlaruppe's hand. Knockerless are
the gates of Gliddon! Of its lion the divan is bereft!</p>

<p class='c000'>The lynx-eyed C 16 beheld the wrong. His dander arose. He drew his staff
in vengeance. He seized the noble Phlaruppe. Sutton, the heavy-handed son
of Africa, raised his arm. His white teeth grinned defiance on the blue son of
Peel. Into the murky waters of the kennel he hurled the pride of the yard of
Scotland. His blood crimsoned the flags. Groaning for help, he sprang the
rattle of war.</p>

<p class='c000'>Like rockets at Vauxhall the azure force of Rowan rushed up. Their hands
grasped the staff of power. Phlaruppe heard the tramp of their Wellingtons. He
sounded the Lullalietee of battle. He gathered his warriors around him. Firm
as the cement of Pouloo they stood. As a torrent from a shower-bath poured the
stiff-necked sons of Peel upon the foe.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the cats of Kilkenny they fight. Like the shop of the maker of trunks rings
the street with the blows. Stained is the earth with the claret of life.</p>

<p class='c000'>Battle of the Garden of Covent, why should Ossian, like Robins, the chief of
Garraway's, pen the catalogue of thy wounds? Thou art with the son of Kean, a
calamity of the past.</p>

<p class='c000'>The force of the Yard of Scotland overcame!</p>

<p class='c000'>On the stretcher of Ignominy, Phlaruppe, the Lord of Belgravia, was laid!</p>

<h4 class='c017'>DUAN THE THIRD.</h4>

<p class='c008'>In the cell of the Station, Phlaruppe hiccups out the Morn. The benches of
wood pillow his burning head. He sighs for a draught of the sparkling Waters of
Carrara, or a goblet of the bubbling Powders of Seidilitz. But the ice of the Lake
of Wenham is not more cold than the hearts of his victors. In the cell of the
Station, Phlaruppe hiccups out the Morn.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the throne of Justice the even-handed Twyford sits. Before him Phlaruppe,
Belgravia's hope, is dragged. He quails, for the voice of the Judge is severe as
Hicks the lusty-lunged Son of the Surrey. And lo! to the terrors of Brixton's wheel
an alms-seeking child of want he condemns. What then shall be the doom of
Phlaruppe?</p>

<p class='c000'>But Phlaruppe is the Lord of Belgravia. In his presence the heart of Twyford,
the even-handed, grows soft as the Asphalte of Claridge before the Sun in the
days of the Dogs. With the milk of human kindness the veins of his bosom are
filled. Pity touches his heart-strings; and his tone with compassion is soft as the
Piccolo of Jullien, the Emperor of all the Polkas.</p>

<p class='c000'>But why, Maid of the Rainbow, should Ossian, like a penny-a-liner, recite the
fine that Phlaruppe paid to his Queen; or tell how the generous Twyford, for a
crown, forgave him who tore the Lion's head from Gliddon's halls?</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>JUPITER AND THE MOTHER.<br /> AN IDYLL.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>At the altar of Jupiter knelt a poor woman. She was about to
become a Mother, and thus she invoked the God:—</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh Jupiter! King of the Heavens! and Ruler of the Earth!
grant that the dear burthen which I now bear may be a Stranger
to the cares of Life! Vouchsafe unto it such gifts that it may be
the most admired of all thy Children,—the richest—the happiest
of Men. Oh Jupiter! King of the Heavens! and Ruler of the
Earth! hear me!"</p>

<p class='c000'>She spoke, and Mercury, the winged messenger of Jove, stood
before her.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Mortal!" said he, "return with Joy to thy hearth! He who
wieldeth the sceptre of Fate hath heard thy petition; and the
Child shall be as thou hast asked."</p>

<p class='c000'>In time the Mother bore a Son. His form rivalled that of the
boy-god Cupid. And she rejoiced to think he was the blest of
Jupiter.</p>

<p class='c000'>A year passed on, and the proud Mother saw the Infant bud
blossom into the Child.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the second year came and went, and the Boy increased not
in Stature.</p>

<p class='c000'>The third year stole away, and still the little thing grew not.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fourth—the fifth—the sixth rolled by, and yet the Child
remained in figure as at the end of the first.</p>

<p class='c000'>Albeit the Mother murmured not, for she remembered the
promise of him who wieldeth the sceptre of Fate, and hoped in
patience.</p>

<p class='c000'>But when twelve summers had gone, and the anxious Matron
beheld her Boy still a Babe in form though a Youth in years,
Hope and Patience left her; and thus she complained:—</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh Jupiter! Jupiter! have the promises of the Gods become
as those of Men? Didst thou not in thy bounty vouchsafe unto
me a Boy that should be the most admired of all thy Children?
And what hast thou sent me? A little thing to whom even the
shape of Manhood is denied! and at whose stunted figure the
world gapes with pitying wonder. Oh Jupiter! Jupiter! for what
mysterious good hast thou thus visited me?"</p>

<p class='c000'>The cloud-compelling Jove heard the Mother's murmurs and
thus from on high rebuked her:—</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>"Why, Child of Clay! dost thou question the goodness of the
Gods? Thy petition was heard, and has been granted. What
more wouldst thou have had? Didst thou not beseech me that
thy Boy should be the richest and happiest of Men?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I did, Great Jove!" replied the trembling Mother; "but thou,
in thy strange bounty, hast given to me a Child with limbs too
small and weak to earn even the scantiest subsistence; and whose
wretched deformity must make his life a burthen to him and me."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And what, blind Mortal! wouldst thou that I had done?"
exclaimed the God.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh that thou hadst blest him with a form of Power, and a mind
of Genius!" cried the heavy-hearted parent; "then would Wealth
and Joy have gladdened his days."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Fool that thou art!" said the Sovereign of the Skies; "listen
and learn how I have blest, and thou wouldst have curst, thy
Child! Had I conferred on him the Genius thou sighest after he
would have felt but Want and Neglect in the world. Had I quickened
him with a sense of the Beautiful, his Life would have been a
Misery—his Death a Crime. For know that Mind alone can
sympathize with Mind; and mindless Man enriches those who
minister rather to the luxury of his Senses than to the refinement
of his Intellect."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, all-wise Jove!" exclaimed the abashed Mother.</p>

<p class='c000'>"See how thou wouldst have beggared thy Boy with Genius,"
continued the Thunderer. "And now listen how I have enriched
him with Deformity. He shall go forth a wonder to the staring
and senseless world. Monarchs shall smile upon him, and rejoice to
gird his neck with precious Jewels. He shall be the beloved of
Matrons, and the fondling of Damsels. Crowds shall flock to behold
him, heaping his little lap with countless riches and costly
gifts. His car shall be drawn through the public ways in triumph;
and he—the stunted dwarf—shall play the Giant Emperor among
men. Thank thou, then, the Gods, oh Woman! whose bounty has
given thee a Dwarf, and not a Genius for thy Child."</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus spake the mighty Jove, and the Mother in gratitude cried
out:—</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, Jupiter! King of the Heavens, and Ruler of the Earth!
I thank thee! for now I see thou hast, indeed, vouchsafed that my
Boy shall be the most admired of all thy Children—the richest—the
happiest of Men."</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>SIR THOMAS BROWN ON WELSH RABBITS.<br /> BEING A CONTINUATION OF HIS "INQUIRIES INTO VULGAR AND COMMON<br /> ERRORS."</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The common opinion of the Welsh Rabbit conceits that it is a
species of <em>Cuniculus</em> indigenous to Wales; of which assertion, if
Prescription of time and Numerosity of assertors were a sufficient
Demonstration, we might sit down herein as an orthodoxical Truth,
nor should there need ulterior Disquisition. <em>Pliny</em> discourseth of it
under the Head of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Animalibus Walliœ</span></i>. <em>Seneca</em> describeth it as
an exosseous Animal, or one of the invertebrated or boneless kind.
<em>Claudian</em> saith that it delighteth to burrow underground in Coal
Holes and Cyder Cellars. <em>Scaliger</em> affirmeth it to be like to the
Hyena, incapable of Domitation or taming, for the cause that he
never heard of one being domesticated in a Hutch. <em>Sarenus Sammonicus</em>
determineth it to be like unto the Salamander, moist in the
third degree, and to have a mucous Humidity above and under the
Epidermis, or outer skin, by virtue whereof it endureth the Fire for
a time. Nor are such conceits held by Humane authors only, for
the holy Fathers of the Church have likewise similarly opinioned.
<em>St. Augustine</em> declareth it to be an unclean Animal; insomuch that
like to the Polecat it is Graveolent, emitting a strong Murine, or
Micy Effluvium. <em>The Venerable Bede</em> averreth that it is Noctiparent,
as the Bat or Owl, and seldom quitteth its Warrenne until
Midnight, for food; for the reason that being Cœcigenous, or possessing
no organs of Vision, it loveth Tenebrosity.</p>

<p class='c000'>All which notwithstanding, upon strict inquiry, we find the
Matter controvertible. <em>Diodorus</em>, in his Eleventh Book, affirmeth
the Welsh Rabbit to be a creature of Figment, like unto the Sphinx
and Snap-Dragon. <em>Mathiolus</em>, in his Comment on <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dioscorides</span></i>,
treateth it not as an Animal, but as a Lark. <em>Sextius</em>, a Physitian,
saith that having well digested the matter, he was compulsed to
reject it; whilest <em>Salmuth</em>, the Commentator of <em>Pancirollus</em>, averreth
that one <em>Podocaterus</em>, a Cyprian, kept one for Months in a Cage,
without ever having attained the sight of the remotest Manifestation
of Vitality.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, besides Authority against it, Experience doth in no way
confirm the existence of the Welsh Rabbit as an Animant Entity.
But, contrariwise, the principles of Sense and Reason conspire to
asseverate it to be, like unto the Myths of Paganism, an Inanimant
Body, vivificated by the Ignoration and Superstitiosity of men. For
had they but inquired into the Etymon, or true meaning of the
name of the Entity in question, they would have experienced that
it was originally merely the Synonyme for a British Dainty, or
Cymric Scitamentum; insomuch as it was primitively appellated,
"The Welsh Tid, or Rare-Bit;" which, by elision, becoming Metamorphosed
into Ra'bit, was, from its Homophony, vulgarly supposed
to have respect to the <em>Cuniculus</em> rather than to the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Scitamentum</span></i>
of Wales.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, the Doctrine of the Existence of the Welsh Rabbit as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>Vivous Entity, doth in nowise accord with the three definitive Confirmators
and Tests of things dubious: to wit, Experiment, Analysis,
and Synthesis. And first by Experiment. For if we send to Wales
for one of the Rabbits, vernacular to the Principality, we shall discriminate
on the attainment of it, no Difformity in its Organism
from that of the Cuniculi vulgar to other Countries. And if we then
proceed to discoriate and exossate the Animal thus attained, or to
deprive it of both its Skin and Bones, and after to macerate the
residuary Muscular Fibre into a papparious Pulp, we shall experience,
upon diffusing the same on an <em>Offula tosta</em>, or a thin slice of toast,
that so far from the concoction partaking in the least of the delectable
Sapor of the Welsh <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Scitamentum</span></i>, it will in no way titillate the lingual
Papillæ, but, contrariwise, offer inordinate Offence to the Gust.</p>

<p class='c000'>And, secondly, by Analysis, If, in the stead of sending to Wales,
we betake ourselves to any Hostelrie or place of Cenatory Resort,
vicine to Covent Garden (whereanent they be celebrious for the concoction
of such like Comestibles, for the Deipnophagi or eater of
Suppers), and thence provide ourselves with one of the Welsh Rarebits
or Scitamenta, whereof we are treating, we shall discriminate
upon the Dissolution or Discerption of its parts, that it consisteth
not of any Carnal Substance, but simply of a Superstratum of some
flavous and adipose Edible, which, to the Sense of Vision, seemeth
like unto the Unguent, denominated Basilicon, or, the Emplastrum
appellated Diachylon; whilest to the Sense of Olfaction it beareth
an Odour that hath an inviting Caseous or Cheesy Fragror, and
fulfilleth all the conditions and Predicaments of caseous matter or
Cheese, which hath undergone the process of Torrefaction; whereof,
indeed, if we submit a portion to the Test of the Gust, we shall,
from the peculiar Sapor appertinent thereto, without Dubitation
determine it to consist.</p>

<p class='c000'>And, thirdly and lastly, by Synthesis. If we provide ourselves
with about a Selibra or half pound of the Cheese, entitulated
<em>Duplex Glocestrius</em>, or Double Gloucester; and then go on to cut
the intrinsic caseous Matter into tenuous Segments or Laminæ;
and, positing such Segments within the coquinary commodity distinguished
by Culinarian's as the <em>Furnus Bataviœ</em> or Dutch Oven,
submit the same to the Fire, until by the action of the Caloric they
become mollified unto Semiliquidity: whereupon, if we diffuse the
caseous fluid on an Offula of Bread, the Superfices whereof hath
been previously torrified, and then Season the same with a slight
aspersion of the Sinapine, Piperine, and Saline Condiments, or with
Mustard, Pepper, and Salt, we shall find that the Sapor and Fragror
thereof differ in no wise from the Gust and Odour of the Edible
we had præ-attained from the Covent Garden Cœnatorium; and,
consequentially, that the Welsh Rabbit is not, as the Vulgar
Pseudodox conceiteth, a species of Cuniculus vernacular to Wales,
but as was before predicated, simply a Savoury and Redolent Scitamentum
or Rarebit, which is much existimated by the <em>Cymri</em> or
Welsh people, who, from time prætermemorial, have been cognized
as a Philocaseous, or Cheese-loving, Nation.</p>

</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>(<em>Strictly private and confidential.</em>)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>My very dear Friends</span>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I have frequently observed your praiseworthy though unavailing attempts
to reduce your domestic expenses, by getting your wards and daughters
"off your hands." I regret to say I have seen much energy on your parts
misdirected, and many an elegant and expensive supper given by you to no
purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, to prevent these failures in future, and to allow the "dear girls"
a better chance of getting "comfortably settled" in life, I am about to confide
to you a secret, which experience has shown me to be well worth
knowing.</p>

<p class='c000'>What I would first ask you, is the primary object of all evening parties?
Why do you engage Weippert's band, or order your supper and ices from
Gunter? Is it—candidly now between ourselves—to make your friends
happy? Or is it not to catch some amiable and independent young bachelor,
who is willing to make your girl the partner of his bosom and banker's
account? Of course you are people of the world, and don't mind throwing
one of Gunter's sprats to catch an aristocratic herring.</p>

<p class='c000'>To command success, however, in this style of marital fishing, one thing,
let me tell you, above all, is necessary, and that is, a conservatory leading
from the ball-room. Think, oh ye Parents and Guardians! for a moment of
the advantages of such an arrangement.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bashful or timid young man, after the quadrille, is sure to propose a
temporary retirement among the flowers, because they afford him something
beyond the weather to talk about, and if he only be matrimonially disposed,
no place—depend upon it—is more likely to make him speak out. For
instance, he asks the young lady to pick him a Camelia, she does so of course,
and, if she has nice eyelashes, takes advantage of the opportunity afforded
her, to display some little timidity and the said eyelashes while arranging
the leaves. But if not blest with those bewitching adjuncts to a pretty face,
I have known a half-suppressed sigh from the interesting creature answer
very well; for your bashful young gentleman very frequently labours under
the notion that he is a lady-killer; and ten to one but he is thus led to think
he has made a conquest of the poor girl, and so, resolving to make her happy,
proposes on the spot.</p>

<p class='c000'>The conservatory is quite as useful for what is called "the fast man,"
or for the man of the world, or indeed for any other species of the genus
<em>homo</em>; though of course the treatment must in each of these cases be
judiciously varied.</p>

<p class='c000'>Your "fast man"—who is generally given to capacious coat-sleeves, and
an eccentric narrowness of neckcloth—prefers a young girl with "something
to say for herself," and who does not leave him to supply all the conversation.
"The agreeable rattle" should therefore be kept up by the young
lady, and if the dear girl have a pretty hand she may take off her "Houbigant,"
and amuse herself by dipping her taper fingers in the basin of the
little fountain, with its three miserable gold fish. The "fast man" will then
probably essay a joke, or a compliment, whereupon the young lady may playfully
sprinkle him with a few drops of water; and thus, doubtlessly, matters
will proceed, until the "rapid" gentleman thinks her "a deuced nice girl
with no nonsense about her;" so that the flirtation, if not nipped by bad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>management in the bud, may, in due course of time, blossom into a
proposal.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a sentimental young man the "language of flowers" presents a very
"taking" subject for conversation; while to the scientific bachelor, a conservatory
affords an easy means for a botanical discussion; besides, the
examination of a plant is sure to bring the faces of the couple into proximity;
and no disciple of Linnæus, however ardent, is proof against that peculiar
thrill which is caused by a pretty girl's glossy and perfumed ringlets brushing
against the cheek.</p>

<p class='c000'>With the matter-of-fact young man a conservatory is quite as useful. He
likes his own comfort better than anything else, and considers the supper the
best part of the evening; a seat among the flowers saves him the trouble of
dancing, so that he will think any young lady "a very sensible girl" for
proposing such a thing; and, as he considers himself a very sensible young
man, why of course the sensible young man would like a sensible young lady
for his wife.</p>

<p class='c000'>In all these arrangements a maiden aunt, or the useful "friend of the
family," should be stationed near the conservatory door; for occasionally the
"dear girls" are disposed to flirt with Captains, with large moustachios and
small means. All elderly mammas having unmarried daughters should be
carefully excluded, as every mother of a family is well known to take a
malicious delight in interrupting promising affairs of this kind, when their
own girls do not form part of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</span></i>.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Believe me, my dear Friends, yours very sincerely,</div>
      <div class='line in28'><span class='sc'>A Victim to a Conservatory.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c007'>ADVICE TO YOUNG LADIES.</h3>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>My Dear Creatures</span>,</p>

<p class='c000'>Yes, you are all dear to me—so dear that when I watch you, as
I do at times, most anxiously, I feel how sadly you stand in need of an
adviser.</p>

<p class='c000'>But do not alarm yourselves! I am not going to be ill-natured. No! I
will not find fault with Miss Crinoline's bustle; though I certainly must confess
it is rather absurd to see her doing the very agreeable in one room, with
the hind breadths of her skirt half-way across another. Nor will I say anything
to Miss Nude about wearing her dresses so low as she does; for though
I am an ardent admirer of the "blanches épaules," still I cannot help observing
that she does allow her gown to slip a <em>leetle</em> too far off her shoulders
sometimes. But I can't spare Miss Carney, who calls Miss Nude "dear,"
and then tells me confidentially, "how bad it looks to see such a nice girl as
she is go about with her shoulders so dreadfully exposed; that it really makes
people think her so bold, and that it's pity some one doesn't tell her of it."
And this Miss Carney does with a look of such pretty pity that for a moment
I think she is the most good-natured creature since Mrs. Adam, and feel
inclined to run and tell the bare shoulders that she ought to be ashamed of
herself. It's a great mark of talent in a young lady, by-the-bye, to be able
to say ill-natured things in a good-natured way.</p>

<p class='c000'>And I should most strongly recommend Miss Madonna, who wears her
hair plain, not to find fault with Miss Chevelure's crisp ringlets. Why
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>should Miss Madonna say they are not becoming? Miss Chevelure's soft
blue eyes and aquiline nose certainly proclaim her to be the prettier of the
two; and I would bet my favourite whisker that Miss Madonna is a far
better customer to Isadore for cosmetique, bandoline, fixature, and other
toilet luxuries than she of the crisp ringlets whom she decries. And why
should Miss Madonna be severe upon Miss Blue Stocking (whom she calls
her "dear Cloè," and rushes to embrace when she enters the room)? Why
should she say that Miss Blue Stocking has her hair dressed "à la Chinoise,"
to show off her forehead, and make her look more intellectual? But I don't
believe it; though I certainly must say that it would be better if the fair
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bas bleu</span></i> did wear her hair a little less like the ladies of China, and a little
more like those of England.</p>

<p class='c000'>My dear creatures, take my advice—never call a young lady "dear,"
when every one knows you detest her; and never try to exalt yourselves by
the detraction of others. Depend upon it, the diminishing spectacles of
envy do not become you.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again: I don't like to hear Miss Pertness abusing Captain Rover, and
calling him an impudent fellow and a coxcomb in so spiteful a tone; especially
when I know that a few evenings back she danced with him nearly
every quadrille, and that she is now curling her pretty lip simply because
Miss Flirt's sparkling eyes have bewitched the Captain for a time. Nor
should Miss Pertness run across the room to Miss Prude (whom she laughs
at for "dressing like a girl of eighteen, when all the world knows she's thirty,
if she's a day"), to point out how the said Miss Flirt is coquetting with the
said Captain Rover.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rest assured, my dear creatures, when you can say nothing good of any
one, the best way is to keep your pretty mouths closed, and to say nothing
at all. Talk any little innocent nonsense you like that is natural to you;
but do not, for goodness sake, be satirical or ill-natured. Leave that to
philanthropists.</p>

<p class='c000'>Above all, don't flirt <em>too</em> much: it's very dangerous, and may ruin your
prospects in the world. For rely upon it, that though most men like flirts
very well for an evening, they would hardly think of linking themselves to
one for a lifetime.</p>

<p class='c000'>Moreover, don't affect blueness, or music-madness, or any kind of literary
or scientific mania: though if you must, for mercy sake, don't be silly
enough to believe that you show your intellect by neglecting your dress or
personal appearance. Philosophy and Polkas are very distinct things; so
either throw up one or the other; for the song that says, "I must have lov'd
thee hadst thou not been fair," is one of those fictions that Bunn and the
other British Poets have been in the habit of getting set to music, and foisting
on the public from time immemorial.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, adieu! and though I am quite aware that the main object of your
lives is to make us the slaves of your charms, and then to render us miserable
by marrying us (the bare idea sets us trembling), still we wish you success
the most brilliant. May Park phaetons, opera-boxes, diamond suites, and
even coronets and plain gold rings, be showered at your dear little feet;
and, above all, may you be happy, whether your wedding-cards bear the
address of Belgrave Square or Clapham Common.</p>

replies, "Why, by carrying my bones and fat to the real original Black
Doll, No. 12," &amp;c. Another racy repository exhibits a grand transparency,
representing a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</span></i> between the Black Doll and one of her fellow-countrymen,
in which the dark gentleman, in a most unniggerly dialect, is
made to ask, "Why, Dinah, do all the people come to Massa's shop?" and
Dinah to reply, "Because Sambo, Massa gives the best price for all old-iron,
linen rags, and kitchen stuff." Then there is the highly popular bellman,
who is eternally crying, "Oh yes! Oh yes! WE (!) are now giving two-pence
for three pounds of old bones," &amp;c. And last of all, the exceedingly
tempting inquiry, "Do you want a plum pudding?" of which dainty there
is prefixed a splendidly coloured caricature, and for which one spirited
rag merchant subjoins the following curious recipe:—</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Black Doll's Receipt for a Good Plum Pudding.</span></h4>

<p class='c008'>Take 8lbs. of the best white linen rags, 4lbs. of broken flint glass, and
12 ditto of old bones; throw in a handful of old nails, with a few horses'
shoes, and flat irons at discretion. Put these into a bag, and bring them
to No. 12, &amp;c., and you will find that it will make you a good family plum
pudding; but if you wish to give it additional richness, you should add a
few pounds of kitchen-stuff, and put a pound or two of candles into the
grease pot.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>THE HONOUR OF THE READER'S COMPANY IS REQUESTED TO<br /> A DINNER PARTY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The Dining Room's quite a sight! The Chairs have had their pinafores
taken off for the occasion, and now stand out in all the glory of
Morocco. The table, which in the morning was only a modest square, has
by means of its telescope been stretched into an oblong. You can count
the number of guests by the number of chairs, and before each seat stands a
small cluster of wine glasses, of different shapes and colours, two plates, and
a napkin folded into the form of a triangle, with a small sandball-looking
French roll secreted within it. The salt has changed its colour—is pink,
and looks flushed with excitement. The supernumerary silver has been taken
from its catacomb of the plate chest, where it has been kept since the last
grand dinner, shrouded in wash leather, and like an old Dowager has now
been rouged into brightness.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the Sideboard stands Kitson, the host, with a shiny soapy face, decanting
the wine, and consequently in a bad humour. And the honest Coal and
Potato Warehouseman, who "beats carpets and attends evening parties," is
fortifying himself in the passage by swallowing all that is left at the bottom
of the bottles, with a look of extreme disgust for all spirituous liquors; and
Master Kitson is helping his Father with the Wine, and himself to the Almonds
and Raisins, when the Governor is not looking. On one side stand
half a dozen of generous Port, in rich coats of Cobweb, with their chalk
fronts; and on the other, two or three bottles of that tall, stately-looking,
silver-headed, dinner-party-drinking Champagne.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Drawing-room is Mrs. Kitson, in a dreadful state of mind, standing
on a chair—on which she has spread her handkerchief, from the fear of soiling
the damask of the cushion—groaning over the Ormolu Lamp, and trying
to discover why it has been dripping on the yellow satin Ottoman beneath.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the midst of this a hungry double knock comes at the door, and the
hostess has just got time enough to snatch one of the showily-bound books,
which are placed at regular distances round the drawing-room table, and
arrange herself and her dress on the Sofa, with a look of deep interest, when
the Coal and Potato Warehouseman announces the first small appetite in a
voice that savours strongly of "Below." And in the said small appetite
walks in a love of a dress that talks French as fast as it can rustle. The
conversation takes a lively turn, first, as to the weather, and then as to the
children of the two establishments, each fond mother trying to make out
that "her dear Herbert" or "her dear Kitty" was more delicate than the
other fond Mother's sweet offspring.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now the hungry double knocks come quicker and stronger, and the plates
and the glasses jingle a kind of chorus. The next-door neighbours keep
running to the windows, and are quite sure there is something going on at
the Kitson's, and feel highly indignant at people not treating their neighbours
as themselves, and vow revenge at their next evening party. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>is a small crowd of half a dozen errand-boys and nursery-maids in front of
the house, who closely criticise the dress of each small appetite as it arrives.</p>

<p class='c000'>The company now are only waiting for the family Doctor; and Mrs. K.
begins to have dreadful visions of the haunch of Venison done to a cinder,
and the Turbot about the consistency of curds and whey. Every now and
then young Kitson comes into the room and whispers into his mother's ears,
and receives a mysterious something, that sounds like keys. Kitson has got
three or four of his old Cronies together, and is letting them into the secret
of some miraculous quack pill, and how it has done him a world of good.</p>

<p class='c000'>At length in walks the dilatory family Doctor, with a volume of splendid
excuses, and, being a jocular man of the world, he easily obtains a pardon.
Then comes a general move for the dinner-table, where Mrs. Kitson looks
over a kind of Index of the Chairs, which she has on a card, and tells each
party where he or she is to eat his or her dinner; by which contrivance she
cleverly manages to place bashful gentlemen next to talkative ladies, and
bashful ladies next to talkative gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the family Doctor insists on Mrs. Kitson letting him help the Turbot,
whereupon Kitson informs the whole table that he shall be jealous if the
Doctor "goes on in that way," which being, of course, a good joke, causes
the guests to giggle unanimously. Every now and then the Doctor does a
witticism, whereat the Coal and Potato Warehouseman, who is of a facetious
turn of mind, chuckles inwardly, and manages to lodge a slice of Venison or
a cutlet in some lady's back hair. Now Kitson gives a mysterious nod, and
immediately Champagne is handed round, and Master K. ventures on a
glassful; on which his Father looks as black as gentility will allow him, and
determines within himself not to allow Augustus to dine at table again
until he knows how to behave himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the removal of the cloth Mrs. Kitson's proud moment arrives. She
has thrown the whole strength of the footman into the French polish, and
her domestic reputation stands upon her tables. At the sight of them all
her female friends fall into violent admiration, and, "How <em>do</em> you do it; I
can never get ours half as bright," &amp;c., &amp;c., bursts from every housewife.
With the Dessert come the dear little Master and Miss K.'s, beautifully got
up with bear's grease and pink sarsenet for the occasion, but looking rather
pale from the effects of having dipped their tiny fingers into each dish as it
left the Parlour (the Doctor is in doubt whether it arises from Bile, or a
nasty Influenza that is flying about); and each of the ladies begs to have
"the little pets" next to her.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now the gentlemen begin tempting the ladies, by cutting oranges into the
shapes of lilies and baskets, or cracking nuts for them. And so matters proceed,
until Mrs. Kitson looks inquiringly at each lady, and each lady having
smiled in answer, they all rise and make for the door, which two or three of
the younger gentlemen rush to open. As soon as they have departed, the
gentlemen draw near to the fire, and Kitson says, "Let us be comfortable,"
and puts on the table such wines as weak woman is unable to appreciate.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>Then come Claret, Old Port, and Politics, and with the sixth bottle they
begin discussing Moral Philosophy. Mrs. Kitson's health is at length proposed
by the family Doctor, who speaks of her as "the exemplary wife—the
tender mother—and the woman whom to know is to admire, ay! and he
<em>would</em> say—to love." And then Kitson wants words to express his feelings
for the honour they have done him, and winds up his catalogue of Mrs. K.'s
virtues with a tear. Now "the exemplary wife" upstairs gets nervous
about her husband and the wine below, and sends the footman in every ten
minutes to say that "Tea is ready." Suddenly the ladies commence singing,
and the family Doctor, who lives but to please, proposes to join them.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as the gentlemen have retired upstairs, Kitson, who remains below,
carefully locks up the remnants of the fruit and wine, and reminds Master
K. of that little affair of the Champagne, and trusts he may never have to
speak to him on that subject again. Then the gentlemen upstairs ask
each lady in turn to oblige them with a song, and after considerable difficulty,
prevail upon Mrs. Kitson's unmarried sister to favour them with "Did you
ne'er hear of Kate Kearney;" but unfortunately the nuts spoil the runs.
And then the gentlemen begin to have a strong inclination for Sofas and
forty winks, and will put their "nasty greasy heads" on the bright yellow
satin damask cushions. And then the company grows very silent; so that
Kitson, who can't get up his rubber, is not sorry when he hears the Coal and
Potato Warehouseman announce the first carriage. Then comes the hunting
for Cloaks, and the running for Cabs, and the giving generous shillings
and very generous half-crowns to the Coal and Potato Warehouseman, who is
very careful to be at the door as each party is leaving. At length they have
all gone, and Kitson tells his better half to see the plate right, and retires
to bed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next morning he is very surly all breakfast, and very late for business,
and Mrs. K. speaks out about the quantity of wine that was drunk; and the
family, much to the delight of the little K.'s, have the remainder of the jellies,
and other good things, for dinner all the next week.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>PEOPLE ONE MEETS IN SOCIETY.<br /> </h3>
<h4 class='c017'>No. 1.<br /> THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO HAS JUST GOT HIS COMMISSION.</h4>

<p class='c008'>Do you see that young man at the top of the quadrille, dancing with that
pretty flaxen-haired girl? That's Arthur Bumpshus; he has just got his
commission; though one might guess as much, for he's paying more attention
to himself, as you perceive, than to his partner, and he holds his coat by
both of the lapels, so as to keep it off his shoulders, while he puffs out his
chest like a pouter pigeon. His hair too, you observe, is cut very short
behind, and frizzed out at the sides, and stuck up at the top, with the true
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>military effect; and whenever his partner speaks to him he looks down on
the floor, and, inclining his head slightly on one side, listens with a haughty
frown.</p>

<p class='c000'>The quadrille is over, and now here he comes. Hark! he's talking to the
flaxen-haired girl about Chatham, and the Provisional Battalion, and the
Mess, larding his conversation with as many military technicalities as he can
possibly cram into it, though, between you and me, he has not yet joined his
regiment, and has dined only once—or twice at the outside—at Chatham.
He says, too, that it's deuced unpleasant being bottled up in uniform this hot
weather, though we know for a fact that his own regimentals are not yet
finished, and that he means "to let out at the tailor above a bit" for disappointing
him with his things for this evening. When however a friend asks
him how it is that he does not appear <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en militaire</span></i>, he replies, "Oh, when a
man (rich that, for a boy of eighteen!) is forced to wear uniform he naturally
prefers being in <em>Mufti</em> whenever he can."</p>

<p class='c000'>He walks across the room digging his heels down at every step with a
ferocity intended to inspire all beholders with a high idea of his determination,
and asks, when a person's name is mentioned, whether he's in "the
Service;" and, on being told to the contrary, speaks of him ever afterwards
as "a Civilian." And when the host's young nephew, who is home for the
holidays, accidentally treads on the toe of Mr. Arthur Bumpshus's Patent
Leather Boots, Mr. A. B. frowns in a way that makes the poor youth in the
jacket tremble again in his pumps; for the young military gentleman is
anxious to distinguish himself for his valour in the eyes of his friends.</p>

<p class='c000'>He will not allow the engraver to have any peace until he sends home
Mr. Arthur Bumpshus's cards, with the No. of his regiment printed upon
them; and, when he gets them, Mr. A. B. goes the whole round of his
acquaintance, and calls at the house of each of his friends at a time when he
hopes they are in the park, so that he may have an opportunity of leaving
them one of the bits of glazed pasteboard which announces that he has got
his Commission.</p>

<p class='c000'>He also pays a visit to Laurie, for the purpose of ordering his saddle; and
hearing Major Splatterdash, of "the Heavies," swear at the saddler for
something which is not quite to the Major's satisfaction, the young gentleman
follows his brother-officer's example, and gets a not very gentle hint
from the tradesman, that unless he can behave himself he had better leave
the shop; for though Laurie may consider it worth his while to pocket an
insult from a Major of ten years' standing, it does not exactly answer his
purpose to do the like with a sucking ensign.</p>

<p class='c000'>In short, the young military gentleman persists in making himself as
obnoxious as possible to all people, with the view of impressing them with
his importance, though he forgets that while he is endeavouring to play the
Lion, the Ass's bray continually betrays him.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>No. 2.<br /> THE YACHTING MAN.</h4>

<p class='c008'>"Beg your pardon! hope I've not hurt you; but you were right in the
gangway!" exclaims a light-haired, blue-coated specimen of humanity, as he
enters the ball-room, and treads on the feet, and grinds the head of one of
the guests against the door-post he fancies he is ornamenting; and then he
rushes violently up to the lady of the house, and shakes her hand with
a vehemence more cordial than "<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">comme-il-faut</span></i>;" and then, turning to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>host, apologizes for being so late, declaring that he had carried away every
stitch of canvas he could stagger under, and would have made the house half-an-hour
before, but he'd had a capsize in a cab, and it took him some time to
get under weigh again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he mixes in the crowd, and on closer inspection, you perceive by the
bright buttons on his blue coat, which have a crown and anchor and some
inscription upon them, that he belongs to one of the Royal Yacht Clubs;
while the same bright buttons with the same crown and anchor, &amp;c., only a
size smaller, adorning his white waistcoat, tell you that he is not ashamed
of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>From his conversation we are made acquainted with the important fact
that there had been a match that day at Erith, and that his yacht must have
won only his gaff-topsail was carried away in a squall; and we learn, moreover,
that he fully sympathizes with Lord Freshwater, who would have come
in a good second had not a Hatch Boat run right into his starboard-bow, and
driven her bowsprit clean through his lordship's balloon-jib. And then he
tells the listeners a remarkably funny story of a friend of his, who went for a
cruise with him, and would persist in calling "going on deck" "going upstairs;"
whereat the yachting man laughs immoderately, and takes care all
the evening through to term "going downstairs," "going below."</p>

<p class='c000'>He does not dance much, but whenever he does stand up for a Quadrille he
talks very loud to his partner, saying, "Aye, aye," to all her questions; and
he rushes to the refreshment-room with her directly the dance is over, where
he does not restrict himself to negus and ices, but attacks the port wine at
once.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the supper he does not do much until the ladies have left, and then
he falls to with surprising vigour, and calling the footman on one side, inquires
whether there is any malt to be had. When the beer arrives he professes
an intense contempt for champagne, and says that as far as he is
concerned a glass of two-water grog is better than all the wine in the Docks,
especially when one's on deck at night; all which causes the younger men of
the party to look upon him as a very dashing sort of a fellow. And if by any
chance he is asked for a song, he is sure to squall "I'm afloat," or "A Life on
the Ocean Wave," though his knowledge of such a state of existence must be
very limited, for he has seldom been beyond the Nore, and at farthest to
Ramsgate,—excepting, by-the-by, once, when we believe he did get as far as
the Isle of Wight, during the Cowes Regatta. Nevertheless, a life in his
father's country-house would be more in character with his habits.</p>

<p class='c000'>And when the party is breaking up the Yachting Man is seen in the Hall
putting on a very rough Pea-Jacket, with large horn buttons, and a cap with
a gold-lace band round it. He says something about it's being time to turn
in, as four bells have gone; and having lit a cigar at the hall-lamp, he finally
disappears, chanting—</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>A NEW OPENING FOR VALENTINES.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Valentines have hitherto been sentimental. This is a sad mistake
in a matter-of-fact age, when Love may knock at a person's
door long enough before he will be admitted, unless he comes
handsomely dressed, and with his pockets full of money. The
old conventional altar, with a couple of hearts on it pierced
through with a skewer, which postmen leave at houses wrapped
up in pink covers, on the 14th of February, is but sorry fare
for young ladies who have been educated upon a hot luncheon
every day, and who would sooner have a basin of turtle than
the prettiest pair of pigeons that were ever served up with pink
ribbon on the best satin paper! Lovers forget that we are a
nation of shopkeepers, and should play their counters accordingly.
How much better, instead of sending an immense tulip with
a gentleman sitting inside of it, it would be to forward a small
view of their fortune, drawn out in gold and silver on their banker's
cheque-book! Ladies might not take the trouble to look under the
paper rose, which when pulled out discloses the portrait of a spooney
Adonis, in a blue coat and black moustachios; but a sketch of what
the same "Spooney" intended to do, when married, in the way of a
carriage or an opera-box, would be a puzzle which every young
lady could but be deeply interested in finding out. Beauty is completely
a matter of taste; but a good establishment, with unlimited
millinery, powdered footman, violets all the year round, and subscription
to the French plays, is a simple thing which no two
mammas could possibly dispute about, and which every well-regulated
daughter must appreciate at the very first glance. In
fact, the more such a Valentine was looked at, the more it would be
admired. The question nowadays is not, whether you are handsome—that
concerns your looking-glass only—but whether your
fortune has a handsome figure. Hymen has gone completely into
the commercial line; and the closer Valentines resemble advertisements,
the easier young gentlemen who offer themselves at a "tremendous
sacrifice," will find themselves go off. Cupid has turned
butcher-boy, and it is wonderful how he has enlarged his business
since he has taken to serving his customers with something richer
than a couple of sheep's hearts every day for dinner! For further
inquiries, the young lady is referred to the plate opposite.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>A CURIOUS INQUIRY.<br /> BY A MEMBER OF THE ANIMALS' FRIEND SOCIETY.</h3>

<p class='c008'>I wonder with what feelings does
a cat contemplate a fiddle? Does
the sight of it move his bowels of
compassion? Does he look upon
it as the hated persecutor of his
innocent race for years? Is he
vindictive against it? Does some
inward voice tell him that on
that very spot was murdered
perhaps one of his dearest relations?
Does he feel prompted
to revenge? Does it ever strike
him that it may be his own case to-morrow? If a cat feels all this,
then the sight of a fiddle cannot be the pleasantest object in the
world to him, and I fancy I see in my mind's eye a family of orphan
kittens weeping over a violin as the cruel instrument of their
father's death. But, alas! it's all fiddle-de-dee. Cats have no feelings,
or else every Tom in every village would be a Hamlet!</p>

<p>NOT WITTY HIMSELF, BUT THE CAUSE OF WIT IN OTHERS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Poor Brook Green was always too ready to display his ignorance.
Nothing could restrain him, when he found a good opportunity
A gentleman was showing the Elgin marbles to some ladies in the
British Museum, when Green rushed up to him, and said in the
most positive manner, "Excuse me, sir, but I think you called
those stones marbles!" "I did, sir," replied the gentleman, rather
surprised. "Well, but now look at them, really you cannot call
them marbles." "But I do, sir, I maintain that they are," exclaimed
the gentleman in a simmering passion; "do you pretend
to tell me that they are not the Elgin marbles?" "Pooh, pooh,"
said Green, with a contemptuous smile, "it's ridiculous—you can't
be serious." "Since they are not the Elgin marbles, then, sir,
perhaps you can tell me what they are?" "Oh! that's not for
me to say," answered Brook Green; "but I can only assure these
ladies that they're a precious deal more skittles than marbles," and
he walked away quite triumphantly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Smith and Jones were looking over a new portrait of Buggins,
painted by Muggins. "It's too dark, much too dark," said Jones,
"you can hardly see a thing." "I tell you what it is," exclaimed
Smith, "the lights want bringing up; what do you say, Green?
Don't you think the portrait would look all the better if the lights
were brought up?" "Certainly," he said, and he left the room.
They were wondering what had become of him when he walked in
five minutes afterwards with a pair of lighted candles. "My dear
Green," said Smith, "what have you brought those candles for?"
"Come, that's cool," answered poor Brook; "didn't you say the
lights wanted bringing up?" Jones gave him one of his frowns
which lasted five minutes.</p>

<p class='c000'>He thought every one was imposing on him, and no wonder, for
he was being hoaxed almost every minute of his life. "What's
this!" he asked, whilst looking over some engravings. "That's
Cleopatra's needle, sir." "Well, on my word it's very like a needle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>and a stitch of it must have saved nine of any other needle;" and
he laughed away as if he had made the very best joke in the world.
"And what is this, pray?" he asked, taking up another engraving
"Why, sir, that is the great Pyramid." "Nonsense, my dear
fellow, you make a mistake; if the last was Cleopatra's needle,
this one must be her thimble," and he gave the shopman such a
dig in the ribs that he was kicked out of the shop.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Look at that idiot!" he cried, pointing to a man who was leading
a watering-cart; "will you believe it, I have told him no less than
ten times that all the water is running out of his cart, and yet he
takes no notice of what I say."</p>

<p class='c000'>You could persuade Green to believe any absurdity. "I wish you
would step over to the Bedford, Green," said young Thomson, "and
order me a dozen of port?" "I haven't the time," answered our
hero. "Well, then, will you get me half a dozen; the deuce is
in it, my good fellow, if you haven't time enough for that!"
Green actually went; and he would do the same thing for you
to-morrow. He has been known to get half way over a river, and
then swim back again for fear of not reaching the opposite side.
On another occasion he ordered a pair of globes, but sent them back
because they were not exactly alike. He also had a sun-dial fitted
up in his bedroom, to enable him, as he said, to rise every morning
with the sun.</p>

<p class='c000'>Brook Green's knowledge of literature was very superficial. The
editor of the <em>Quarterly</em> made a wager with him once that he would
not mention a single thing correctly out of Shakspeare. "Can't
I, indeed!" he exclaimed; "why I know his works all through
from beginning to end: first of all, there is a set of chessmen, then
there are two dice-boxes, after that six dices, and lastly, a game of
draughts. I'll just trouble you for the money, if you please." The
poor fellow had always looked upon a backgammon board, which
folded up like a book, as a copy of <span class='sc'>Shakspeare's Works</span>, for so
it was labelled; and he was quite indignant because the editor of
the <em>Quarterly</em> would not pay him the wager, which he considered
he had fairly won.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>THE DUTY OFF TEA.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>We wonder the ladies never agitated for the reduction of the duty off tea.
They should have formed an "Anti-Tea League." If they had only laid
their tongues together, the death-rattle of the duty would have sounded for
ever. The noise would have made ministers tremble, and the great wall of
China would have shaken like a row of plates on a kitchen dresser with the
tremendous reverberation. Imagine 12,000,000 tongues calling out "Repeal
the duty off tea!" and then conceive, if you can, what the intensity of that
clamour would be when every one of those 12,000,000 tongues was a female
tongue! We pronounce this omission a terrible <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">lapsus linguæ</span></i> on the part of
the Wives and Daughters and Grandmothers of England. Where, we ask,
is Mrs. Ellis? that formidable female champion of Great Britain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Let us suppose that this Utopia has arrived. Tea is free! Bohea has
burst its fiscal fetters, and the "best black" is emancipated from its custom-house
bonds. Now, it has been proved by every political economist that the
cheapening of an article always increases its consumption. What oceans of
tea then will be drank when the luxury can be procured at six farthings a
cup cheaper! "A dish of tea" will be magnified into a soup-tureen; urns
will swell into the size of beer-barrels; and a tea-caddy will assume the
dimensions of nothing smaller than a corn-bin. The carts of "No. One, St.
Paul's," will vie in grandeur with Barclay and Perkins' drays; and John will
be told to go down into the cellar "to bring up another hogshead of the Best
Sixpenny Mixed." Scandal, which, next to the sloe, forms the principal
ingredient in every brewing of tea, will increase also in proportion to the consumption.
No one's reputation will be safe. It will be quite frightful to
calculate the dear innocents who will die the death of kittens in the "social
cup," and the innumerable characters that will be put into scalding water,
and scraped as clean as bitter-almonds, at every "<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Thé Réunion!</span></i>" Washer-women
too—the greatest <em>trait</em> in whose amphibious characters is proverbially
the tea-tray—will be in a state of celestial <em>scan. mag.</em> all day, and will fine-draw
their customers' respectability at the same time that they mangle their
linen. Female society, in short, will grow into a species of Inhumane Society;
and inquests will be held amongst gentlemen after dinner on the lost reputation
of their friends, and the verdict will be "Felo-de-se at Mrs. Candour's
Tea-party," or "Found Drowned in a Teetotaller's slop-basin." Husbands
of England! beware of Cheap Tea, or else the sugar-tongs may be turned
against you in the same way that St. Dunstan treated a certain French
gentleman by the nose.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>THE UNIVERSAL SMASHER.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>"Smash" is a word peculiarly the property
of the "Fast Man." We believe it
means to break, demolish, crush, annihilate.
Like repudiation, it is of American
origin, for we recollect there is the elegant
Yankee term, "eternal smash." A
"smasher," consequently, is one who
smashes; and the Universal Smasher is
a young gentleman whose particular vocation
and amusement is to smash everything
and everybody.</p>

<p class='c000'>We remember meeting with
one, after the first night of a
new comedy, at a popular <em>café</em>,
where the clever young wits
of the day mostly congregate
to lay down
the law for England
upon fashion, literature,
cigars, royalty, casinos,
metaphysics, ballet-girls,
and morality.</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/i_303.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>He attracted our notice first by speaking very loudly, and calling
out, in a voice as voluminous as the late lamented Mr. Toole's,
"Waiter, another bottle of ginger-beer!" It was not so much the
order, as the martial tone in which it was conveyed, that first
awakened our curiosity. We expected, at least, to see a giant. We
turned round and only found a pigmy. It was our wonder how so
big a voice could find a residence in so small a body. But if the voice
was immense, what were the sentiments that we afterwards heard
emanate from the same lips!</p>

<p class='c000'>The poor author, whose piece but two minutes ago had been
announced amidst the greatest applause "for every night until
further notice," was declared to be "an impudent nobody." Every
one of his brilliant jokes was stolen; all his points, only points
gained by cribbage. The young gentleman before us traced the
pedigree of every epigram, gave the descent of each witticism, proved
the birth of the plot, and established beyond a doubt the parentage
of each separate scene. "A comedy, sir! It's no more a comedy
than Joe Miller's a comedy. Dramatise a Jest Book—give it a proverb
for a title, and you will have a better comedy than that. I
tell you what it is, sir,—Jones must be smashed!"</p>

<p class='c000'>He had no sooner come to this decision than there sounded and
resounded a tremendous echo of long-repeated "hip-hip-hurrahs!"
We inquired whence they came. It was a supper-party upstairs
commemorating the glorious triumph of the evening. Poor Jones!
he little thought that moment, when probably he was returning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>thanks for his health, and was full of joy, champagne, and the
happy intoxication of success, that the decree had just been irrevocably
passed that "he must be smashed!"</p>

<p class='c000'>The conversation travelled on. Our unknown friend next criticised
the actors. One was "a stick," another a "pump;" the
gentlemen were "muffs;" the ladies something that may be conceived,
but cannot be printed. The unhappy manager even did not
escape. "He had never seen a piece worse put upon the stage. It
would disgrace a penny theatre. By Heavens! he would show him
up—such a humbug must be smashed!"</p>

<p class='c000'>We looked with awe upon this wholesale "smasher." We trembled
lest we should be the next victim, and involuntarily curled ourselves
up in the dark corner of the box to avoid his destructive notice.</p>

<p class='c000'>A stranger who came in happened to lay upon the table a series
of engravings, which had just been published, and were selling, it
was reported, most extensively. "Excuse me, sir," he said, taking
up one of them; "I hope you've not been buying this rubbish? It
is nothing but a rank imitation of Hogarth—without any of his
talent, execution, or purpose. It is satire diluted to the weakest
gin and water. The fellow who has put his name to it deserves to
be smashed, and I have a good mind to do it."</p>

<p class='c000'>"In mercy, I hope, you will change your mind, sir," said the
stranger, rising and taking off his hat; "or at all events, that you
will stop till I have had my supper. You wouldn't smash a poor
'<em>fellow</em>' with an empty stomach, surely?" and he held out his hand
with smiling good-humour to his intended "smasher."</p>

<p class='c000'>The laugh went against the latter, and seemingly it did not
sweeten much the fine cordial spirit through which he viewed men
and things.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the course of the general conversation "Macbeth" was mentioned.
"Macbeth!" he exclaimed; "a stupid, vulgar melodrama,
only fit for the Britannia Saloon. Why, it wouldn't succeed at the
present day unless it was brought out as a pantomime with plenty
of blue fire. In my opinion, Shakspeare is a tremendous do—I don't
hesitate to say so—and I should like uncommonly to smash him."</p>

<p class='c000'>Tennyson shortly afterwards was declared to be deserving of the
same fate.</p>

<p class='c000'>Byron also was a great mistake; Walter Scott, too, was no better,
and they ought both of them to be smashed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shelley was an impudent pretender, and ought properly to have
been smashed long ago. By Jove, he'd do it some day!</p>

<p class='c000'>It was poor Goldsmith's turn next; but he relented, saying, with
a mutilated sigh, he was scarcely worth smashing.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Milton was "a ponderous take-in—a violent mistake." He
was very good for old women, no doubt, but as heavy as cold
dumpling; and nothing but sheer starvation could force him down
his throat. He wished to Heaven some one would smash him!</p>

<p class='c000'>Present authors were knocked on the head in the same heavy
pavior's-hammer style of criticism. Who was Dickens, pray? only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>an inventory-taker! What was Bulwer? the hero of sixteen novels!
James was a drug—a perfect James's powder: Sheridan Knowles
a Fitzball in blank verse! And as for the ladies, they were all—poetesses,
novelists, political economists, and generous Newgate
visitors—the whole Fry of them, smashed indiscriminately of a heap!
We wonder how so many of them have survived.</p>

<p class='c000'>We never witnessed such cruel slaughter. It was a regular battle
of great men and noble characters. Everybody, no matter how high
or low in the world, was fair game for this Universal Smasher.
His mouth was a Perkins' steam-gun, firing a hundred small shot
every minute. Papers and periodicals were brought down by the
same process of sharp-shooting. The <cite>Times</cite> ought decidedly to be
smashed. It only wanted three good men to do it;—he'd put his
name down for one. The <em>Spectator</em> was a block of Wenham ice—not
even fit for sherry-cobblers. The <em>Athenæum</em> was an immense
<em>but</em>, that butted at everybody. The <em>Examiner</em> bowstringed the
Queen's English, and strangled common-sense. And as for <em>Punch</em>,
it was a damp squib—that was fizzing, or attempting to fizz, every
week; and the sooner it was smashed the better!</p>

<p class='c000'>We felt uneasy in the presence of such a tremendous man. We
longed to possess the faculty of the telescope, and slide into our
selves one-sixth of our natural length. We felt confident, if we
remained much longer exposed to the blows of one who hit so hard,
that we should inevitably be smashed into such very small bits that
if we were ever put together again we should always be pointed at
afterwards as the most curious specimen of mosaic. A runaway
engine in a crockery shop could not create a greater feeling of alarm
amongst the cups and saucers than that infernal little smashing
machine imparted to our fragile nature. We need not say, therefore,
how relieved we felt when a venerable bald head in the room
rose, and very quietly said, "Gentlemen, we have heard and seen a
deal of smashing to-night. Everybody, great and small, has been
smashed in his turn. Not a person, living or dead, has the slightest
reason to complain; they have all been smashed fairly and equally
together. Now, I only want to know, after our friend has smashed
everybody—which he must do if he goes on at the present rapid
rate—whatever will he do ultimately with himself?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh! leave him alone," we could not help exclaiming; "he'll
smash himself!"</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a general laugh, and the Universal Smasher left the
room, giving us, as he passed us, such a look that we felt we were
doomed. That look clearly said—it pierced us like an arrow with
a message tied to it—"To be smashed in our next." We hope all
benevolent souls will pray for us!</p>

<p class='c000'>"Who is he?" we asked, as soon as we breathed again.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Don't you know?" said our neighbour, with the greatest
astonishment. "He's Brown!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Who's Brown?" we inquired, in a faltering voice, and a cold
shiver.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>"It's strange you never heard of Brown! He's the editor of the
<em>Penny Whistle</em>."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, indeed!"</p>

<p class='c000'>We have inquired everywhere—we have offered any sum of money—we
have begged and prayed of newsvendors and friends, and
bookstall-hunters, to buy us, at any price, the <em>Penny Whistle</em>; but
we have not seen yet that fearful work of extermination. We now
offer a reward of 100<em>l.</em>, and our blessing, to anybody who will send
us a copy of it, no matter how dirty it may be. We shall not be
happy till we know positively whether we are smashed or not!</p>

conductor for having brought you so much out of your way.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>How to Live upon Nothing a-Year.</span>—Get elected a Member of Parliament,
and you may contract as many debts as you please without paying one
of them.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>How to get a Dozen of Wine for Nothing.</span>—Go to twelve different
wine-merchants, and get each of them to send you in a sample bottle. You
have only to say afterwards the wine isn't exactly to your taste—you wanted
a much fuller wine—and you may get another dozen by the same means free
of expense.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>How to get a Glass of Warm Brandy and Water for Nothing.</span>—Fall
in the ice, and you will be carried to the Royal Humane Society's establishment,
and a glass of brandy and water will be given to you directly. If
you are very bad a second will be administered, and you will be put to bed,
and have a good "tuck in" into the bargain.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>How to get a Library for Nothing.</span>—Borrow books, and, of course,
keep them.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>How to get a Luncheon for Nothing.</span>—Look in at the auctions, and
patronize one where there is a sale of wine. Take a biscuit with you, and
you may have as many glasses of port or sherry as you please. Just make a
small bid now and then, for recollect Homer sometimes nodded.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>How to Dress for Nothing.</span>—Go to an advertising tailor, and get him
to take out your clothes in poetry. The same with your hatter, bootmaker,

clothes out of it, and its feet must be lame indeed if they do not afford you a
pair of Wellingtons.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>CURIOUS SUMS FOR THE CALCULATING MACHINE.<br /> BY JOLLY COCKER.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Calculate the number of English ladies who understand French
thoroughly; can read it, but cannot speak it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Deduct the amount that has been lost at railways from that
which has been made by them, and state what article of value the
difference (if any) will purchase.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ages of seven elderly ladies amount in their passports to
148; find out their real ages.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ten friends of Green sit down to play at unlimited loo, and 93<em>l.</em>
are lost before the morning. Everybody declares he has lost.
You are to find out, if you can, which of the party has won?</p>

<p class='c000'>The population of the earth is 800,000,000. Required to find
one person who will mind his own business.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thompson (of the Albany) pays 12<em>l.</em> annually for income-tax.
His cigars cost him as much; his opera-stall four times as much;
his horse six times as much; and his gloves, bouquets, bets, and
tiger ten times as much. What is Thompson's real income?</p>

<p class='c000'>A carpet-bag of an ordinary capacity will hold two coats, three
pairs of trousers, one dressing-case, one pair of boots, six shirts,
two night ditto, three pairs of stockings, six collars, and one
dressing-gown. These articles can be put into it with perfect ease
when you are going to make a week's stay in the country. How
much will the same carpet-bag contain if you are going to Boulogne
for an indefinite period?</p>

<p class='c000'>Solomons buys a diamond ring for 1<em>l.</em> He sells it, and loses
"thirty shillings, by Gosh, by it." He buys it again, and sells it
at another loss of 2<em>l.</em> How much does Solomons make by the
ring?</p>

<p class='c000'>Your tailor applies for money; "He has a little bill to take
up." There are 30,000 tailors in London. What is the sum total
of all the little bills they have to take up in the course of the year?</p>

of Triumph" worth?</p>

<p class='c000'>The two Doves are always quarrelling. Mrs. Dove is very ill-tempered,
and Mr. Dove very obstinate. He will smoke cigars at
home—will stir the fire with the bright poker—will bring friends
home late to supper—will whistle; all of which practices Mrs.
Dove abominates. She remonstrates; Mr. Dove retaliates. A
tiff ensues; and Mrs. Dove goes home to her mother. Ascertain

Dove has to pay every year in diamonds, boxes to the opera, new
velvet gowns, and trips out of town.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>ANECDOTES OF SCIENCE.<br /> PERFECTLY ORIGINAL.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Stays</span> were first invented by a brutal butcher of the thirteenth century as
a punishment for his wife. She was very loquacious; and finding nothing
would cure her, he put a pair of stays on her in order to take away her
breath, and so prevent, as he thought, her talking. This cruel punishment
was inflicted by other husbands, till at last there was scarcely a wife in all
London who was not condemned to wear stays. The punishment became so
universal at last that the ladies in their own defence made a fashion of it,
and so it has continued to the present day.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Berlin Gloves.</span>—The custom of servants wearing Berlin gloves at dinner
was introduced by Sir Jonas Bullock in 1811. He had a favourite black
servant who used always to wait at dinner. The Lady Mayoress was dining
with him one Sunday, and she had occasion to call for some blanc-mange.
His black servant brought it to her, when his large black thumb by the side
of the blanc-mange had such a shock upon her ladyship's feelings that she
fainted away and was carried home to the Mansion House in a state of great
danger. She never rallied. Sir Jonas was so hurt by this melancholy
event that he insisted upon his servants for the future always wearing
Berlin gloves when they waited at table; and from this the fashion was
introduced at Devonshire House, and then at Court.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Muffins.</span>—We know very little of muffins previous to Johnson's time.
They are supposed to have been invented by a Scotch physician, who was
attached to the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">suite</span></i> of a German Count who came over with George I.
He gave the recipe for nothing to a baker, on condition of his providing him
with the address of all his customers. The bargain was faithfully carried
out. The physician died extremely rich, and the baker also. Crumpets
and Life Pills were likewise their invention.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Bonnets</span> were made, only fifty years ago, by a French milliner who was
exceedingly ugly. The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gamins</span></i> used to follow her, and laugh at her, calling
her nose, which was very large, the most ridiculous names. This annoyed
the poor milliner, and she invented the bonnet to escape their ribaldry.
The disguise was so effectual that every Frenchwoman who was no prettier
than herself was glad to adopt it. Those who were not ugly formed such a
small minority that whenever they appeared they were sure to monopolize
all the notice and gallantry of the gentlemen. This exposed them to the
sarcasms and envy of their own sex, till they were compelled at last to
assume the same hideous style of head-dress. The marvel is that the fashion
should ever have become popular in England.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Currant-Jelly</span> was first eaten with hare in 1715. There were no potatoes
at table, when the Duchesse de Pentonville (then an emigrant), asked
what there was. "Nothing but confitures," was the reply of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maître
d'hotel</span></i>. "Bring me the confitures, then," said the lively Duchesse; and
she selected the currant-jelly, much to the amusement of all the nobles
present. The king, however, hearing of this, ordered hare for dinner, purposely
to try it with the currant-jelly, and he liked it so well that he continued
it for six days together; and so the currant-jelly spread all over
London till it became an established fashion in the best English society.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Electricity.</span>—Franklin brought down the lightning with a kite; but this
stroke, wonderful as it is, is nothing compared to the daring flight of a Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>Prettiman in the month of September last. After various trials, a few
generous friends having supplied him with rope enough, he succeeded, by
some great attraction, in bringing down 154<em>l.</em> 17<em>s.</em> 2½<em>d.</em>, simply by flying a
little kite in the city; and this, too, was achieved at a time when there was
the greatest difficulty in raising the wind, and there was scarcely a penny
stirring anywhere. He has since tried the experiment, but it has failed
every time, owing, it is reported, to his paper being a little too flimsy.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Triumph of Magnetism.</span>—Dr. Ell—ts—n declared, that by magnetizing
a person he could make him see most clearly the interior of himself. The
Marquis of L—nd—nd—y called, and insisted upon a trial upon himself; no
other proof, he declared, would satisfy him that mesmerism wasn't a hollow
humbug. Accordingly he was put into the most beautiful state of coma.
"Now look into your head," said the Doctor, "and tell me what do you
see?" "See?" answered the magnetized patient; "why, stuff and nonsense!
I see nothing at all." "Look again." "It's quite useless: I tell
you there's nothing in it." The Marquis was quite furious when told the
result of the experiment; but he consoles himself with the reflection that
there is a great deal more in mesmerism than meets the eye. The talented
Doctor has since favoured us with the following aphorism:—</p>

<p class='c021'>"In ridiculing a science, a man cannot look too deeply into his own head before he
declares that there is nothing in it."</p>

<h3 class='c007'>BEWARE.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Beware of a man who travels with a pair of duelling pistols.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beware of a young lady who calls you by your Christian name the first
time she meets you.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beware of port at 30<em>s.</em> a dozen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beware of a lodging-house where you are "treated as one of the family."</p>

<p class='c000'>Beware of every "cheap substitute for silver," excepting gold.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beware of cigars that are bought of "a bold smuggler" in the street.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beware of a wife that talks about her "dear husband," and "<em>that</em> beautiful
shawl" in her sleep.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beware of a gentleman who is "up" to all the clever tricks, and "knows
a dodge or two," at cards.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beware of giving an order to a deaf man on the first night of a new piece.
He is sure to laugh and applaud in the wrong places, and so cause a disturbance
which may be fatal to the success of your farce.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beware of entering a French shop which has the following inscription:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>"<span class='sc'>Here they spike the English</span>,"</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>unless you can speak French very correctly, or are prepared to pay for the
consequences.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>General Observations.</span>—When it is Fair, the servants or guests in the house can
move about with the greatest safety; but if it is at all Cloudy, or the weather looks in the
least Unsettled, then he had better look twice at the above table before he takes the
smallest step, or else he will have the matrimonial storm breaking over his head. If missus
is out, then the atmosphere is generally Fair; but it is invariably Stormy when master
goes out and does not come home for dinner. If master and missus are both in, look out
for a change or a sudden squall; and the eyes of missus will probably point to Wet.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE DOMESTIC SERVANTS' EARLY CLOSING<br /> MOVEMENT.</h3>

<p class='c008'>A great domestic movement is in agitation, which, it is expected,
will convulse the social fabric from the area upwards, and shake
our households, not only to their centres, but to the very top of our
chimney-pots, our weathercocks, and our cowls. The contemplated
measure is a demand on the part of our domestic servants for a
general early closing of all private houses at eight o'clock, so that
after that hour the cooks, housemaids, nursery-maids, and others
in our establishments may go forth in search of moral and intellectual
recreation in the open air. It is argued, and with a considerable
show of justice, that after cooking our dinners, and washing up
our tea-things, the female servant has a right to go and get her
mind cultivated, and her tastes elevated, or, as it were, put in soak
in the fountain of the Muses, to be rinsed, and send forth its
gushings when fitting opportunity might offer.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Domestic Early Closing Movement will entail on the masters
the necessity of limiting their wants, and allowing none to extend
beyond eight <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, which it is contended will be found quite long
enough for all reasonable purposes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The moral and intellectual training will generally be commenced
by the policeman on the beat, but as boldness increases, the domestic
servant may venture to improve her mind at some of the harmonic
meetings in the neighbourhood of her master's residence. Adjacent
barracks will be particularly sought after for the culture which it is
the object of the Female Servants' Early Closing Movement to
obtain.</p>

<p class='c008'>A gentleman of fortune having offered a prize of 100<em>l.</em> for the

Bogue's, as we challenge the world to produce a better worse joke

of a sour disposition, but according to this new discovery it would
seem that the more a lady cries the more her temper is sweetened
by it. By-the-bye, hysterics must be invaluable to a cook on board
wages who has to find her own sugar! What a lump of sweetness,
too, Niobe must have been,—for she was "all tears." To a grocer

<p>EXTRAORDINARY FLIGHT OF LADY BIRDS ON THE SEA COAST.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>SEA-SIDE ENTOMOLOGY.</h3>
</div>

<h4 class='c017'>THE LADY BIRD.</h4>

<p class='c008'>An extraordinary flight of Lady Birds distinguished the annals
of Margate and Ramsgate last year. They covered the coast
for miles, extending all the way to Herne Bay, and even as far as
Gravesend. They are supposed to have been brought from London,
as the decks of the steamers were completely strewed with them.
The piers at all the watering-places, the hotels, the tea-gardens, the
shrimp-parlours, were immediately occupied, and it was a matter of
difficulty, soon after their arrival, to find a single bed empty. The
inhabitants foolishly imagine that these Lady Birds commit a deal
of injury, and they do everything they can to drive them away
from the place. They lay traps in the windows to catch them,
consisting of a piece of pasteboard, on which is inscribed a charm,
of two simple words, "TO LET;" or sometimes it is only one
word, as "<span class='sc'>tOLeTt</span>." Directly the Lady Bird sees this, she knocks
at the door, and flies into the house; but when once she is
inside, she is subject to all the little persecutions which, since the
sea-side was discovered, have been showered upon the poor race of
Lady Birds. She is teased out of her life; she is not allowed to eat
anything in comfort; her meals are taken away from her; till at
last her whole enjoyment is poisoned, and she is glad to wing her
way back again to London. Naturalists, however, have proved
that the Lady Birds do incalculable good to every spot where they
settle. Broadstairs has been built by their pretty exertions. Erith
has been raised by them out of the sand; and Rosherville would
never have been dug out of a chalk-pit if it had not been for the
swarms of Lady Birds! It is true they buzz terribly, and make a
great noise whenever more than two of them appear together; but
this defect is more than counterbalanced by their gay colours, which
resemble the richest silks and satins; and their dazzling appearance,
which sparkles with all the force of diamonds when viewed by
candle-light. Nothing prettier than to watch an assembly of them
in the evening. They crowd at the libraries; they fill the ball-rooms,
where they mimic the movements of the waltz; they throng
Tivoli and St. Peter's, where the fireworks are not more brilliant
than they; they sing, and dance, and laugh, and do everything
like human creatures, but reason. And these are the poor little
harmless creatures whom the inhabitants of the different watering-places
delight in persecuting. Why, they carry gaiety and happiness
wherever they appear; and as for hurting anybody, there is
not a sting amongst a whole townful of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a fiction to suppose that the age of the Lady Bird can be
told by the marks on her back. This provision on the part of
nature would in fact be quite superfluous, for it is very curious that
no Lady Bird at the sea-side is ever less than fourteen, or more
than eighteen.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>The Lady Bird visits the watering-places generally about June,
and stops there till the winter. The first gale blows them back
again to London, where they pass the foggy months in the various
shops, theatres, and ball-rooms. When Tom Thumb was in town,
an extraordinary flight of Lady Birds might be seen every day at
the Egyptian Hall.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>THE MARINE APHIS VASTATOR.</h4>

<p class='c008'>Very different to the Lady Bird is the <em>Aphis Vastator</em>, or commonly
known as the <em>Sea-side Lodging-house keeper</em>. It is a most
ravenous tribe, to be met with at all watering-places. It will eat
through anything. It has consumed, before now, a week's provisions
in a day. It is always seeking somebody to devour. These
vastators, or rather devastators, live mostly on the poor Lady Birds,
who suffer dreadfully from their depredations. A Lady Bird, who
has taken a lodging in the morning, has repeatedly been eaten out
of house and home before the evening, and been obliged to fly for
safety. Nothing escapes the fangs of the Marine Lodging-house
keeper. It will work its way into locked drawers, and runs through
a tea-caddy with as much ease as if it had the key. It will clear a
trunk in a day, and empty a work-box whilst the Lady Bird is
taking a plunge in the sea. Its fangs are so constructed that
they close directly on everything they touch; and their eyes are so
sharp that they protrude into every letter and parcel that comes
into the house. What they do not consume they hide; what they
cannot hide they destroy or else give away; for the male <em>Devastator</em>
is just as nimble as the female, though he is rarely seen. He
comes the last thing at night, and is off the first thing in the morning;
walking off probably—for he has very long legs—with a coat, or
a pair of trousers that was found lying about in your portmanteau.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <em>Aphis</em> has generally a large brood of little <em>Aphises</em>, which
she rears in the back kitchen. They all partake of their mother's
nature. They crawl about the house in search of stockings and
frocks, and from their small size can creep almost into anything.
Their appetites, too, are almost superhuman. They will lift the lid
of a rump-steak pie, which has been left on the landing-place, and,
in less time than you can drink a glass of wine, they will have abstracted
every bit of meat out of it. If they settle on a leg of
mutton they will not leave it before they have picked it clean to
the bone. In fact, their skill in polishing a bone would fill you
with wonder, if nothing else. They shrink from no pastry; and
the largest tart does not appal them. Their powers of suction, too,
are just as great. A bottle is no sooner put upon the table than it
is empty; and if there were twenty bottles they would go through
every one of them, and the stronger the contents the easier the absorbing
process seems to be!</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>Evidence of the Marine Blight on a Leg of Mutton.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>When the winter comes round the <em>Aphis Devastator</em> looks over
her stores, and begins to count if her provisions will last her till the
summer. Her coals are put away into the cellar; her wine and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>spirits are arranged in the different cupboards; her candles are
measured out; and everything placed upon the save-all system.
Woe to her young then, if she catches one of them lifting the lid of
a pie, and helping himself to the solids or fluids within! The
chances are she would eat him up on the spot. The husband's
appetite, too, is put upon a reduced scale, and he is only allowed a
glass of grog when there has been stuffing for dinner, or when
another <em>Aphis</em> drops in. The voracity of the whole family is kept
under during the winter, but then it breaks
out with all the greater fury afterwards.
The legs and shoulders of the first lodger
of the season generally feel this pretty
sharply. He has not a joint which, after
the first day, he can call his own. A blight
invariably follows; for whatever the <em>Aphis Vastator</em> touches is sure
to go immediately.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is difficult to describe the <em>Aphises</em> externally, for they take up
so wonderfully quick the habits of each new lodger that they are
always changing.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>THE CHEMIST'S CAT.</h3>
</div>

<div  class='figleft id007'>
<img src='images/i_322di.jpg' alt='MR. CELSUS PHIPPS' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>was a chemist, not one
of your ordinary men,
who put their trust in
huge coloured glass
bottles, and drive a
large trade in lozenges.
No, Phipps was an experimental
chemist,
and he acquainted the
public with the fact by
means of an inscription
to that effect over
his door, while he confirmed
the neighbours in the belief by occasional explosions more
or less violent. On one occasion he went so far as to blow the roof
off his house, but that, he said, "was an accident." Moreover,
Phipps was a licentiate of Apothecaries' Hall, and jobbed the
paupers at 1½d. a head, including pills and plasters. Mr. Phipps's
establishment was evidently the home for natural philosophy. Experiments
abandoned by every one else were eagerly sought after
by Phipps; and he had a valuable auxiliary in his cat.</p>

<p class='c000'>When science slumbered, the cat might be seen comfortably
dozing on the door-step; but when anything new in medicine or
chemistry turned up, the cat had an active life of it. The poor
thing had taken poison enough to kill hundreds of rich husbands,
and antidotes sufficient to restore double the number. It had a
stomach-pump kept for its especial use. You might generally
guess when anything extraordinary had happened, by missing the
cat from its usual place, and seeing Dick, Mr. Phipps's boy, who
had the job of holding it during the experiments, with slips of
diachylon plaster all over his face and hands. It had become
familiar with prussic acid and arsenic in all their insinuating forms,
and had some slight knowledge of the smaller operations of surgery;
still it went purring about, and was always at hand on an emergency,
ready to have any drug tested on its person. Phipps was
proud of it. "My cat, Tom, sir," he would say, "has done more
for its fellow animal, man, than all the philanthropists that ever
taught people to be discontented."</p>

<p class='c000'>All went on smoothly till the introduction of ether, when Phipps
determined to see if he could extract a tooth from a person under its
influence. The cat, of course, was to be the especial patient. Dick
was summoned, Tom caught, the ether administered, and Phipps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>selected one of the largest tusks. But the ether could not have
taken proper effect; for, with a frightful yell, Tom freed himself
from Dick's grasp, favouring him at the same time with severe
marks of his esteem, which made him roar, and disappear, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la
Harlequin</span></i>, through the plate-glass window, doing immense damage
to the chemicals and Galenicals displayed therein.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Tom soon came back, for no one would have him. Science,
who labels some men F.R.S.'s, or tags half the alphabet to the end
of their names, had not forgotten to mark her humble follower,
the cat. He had lost one ear in some acoustic experiment; one
eye was closed for ever, from having the operation for squinting
practically illustrated some dozen times; and he was lame in one
of his hind legs, the tendon having been cut to exemplify the
method of operating for club-foot; while his coat, once remarkably
glossy, had such a second-hand, seedy appearance that it
would not have tempted a Jew.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last he died, a martyr to science. Phipps had invented some
wonderful pulmonic lozenge, containing a great deal of morphia,
which was to cure coughs at first sight. Tom had been rather
asthmatic for some time, owing to inhaling noxious gases; so
Phipps gave him a good dose to begin with. Next morning he was
found very fast asleep, and extremely rigid in his limbs. Dick
suggested that he was dead, but his master indignantly repudiated
the idea; so Tom was kept, in the full expectation that he would
one day start up quite lively, till at length the moth got into
his coat, and Phipps was compelled to consign his furry friend to
a grave in the garden. Phipps never had his usual spirits again.
His experiments were at an end; for though he would sometimes furtively
introduce some drug or other into Dick's tea or beer, that
young gentleman soon found it out, and took his meals ever afterwards
with his mother, who was the proprietress of a veal-and-ham
pie depôt in an adjacent court. Phipps wanders about the College
of Surgeons a melancholy man, and amuses himself dreaming
over experiments he would perform if he could only get such
another cat! He is not best pleased however, when he meets any
young friend of Dick's, who violates private confidence by running
after him and inquiring at the very top of his voice, "Who killed
the cat?"</p>

<p class='c000'>Our pretty little pack of Belgrave Square Harriers had their
first winter meeting on Thursday last at Lady Hurtleberry's.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is impossible to conceive a more desirable place for the sport
of their hunting than her Ladyship's. The gorgeous rose-coloured
damask hangings give the finest possible tone to the complexion,
the purple-flowered <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tapis</span></i> sets off the foot to the greatest advantage,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>whilst a grand piano by <span class='sc'>Broadwood</span>, and a harp by <span class='sc'>Erard</span>, afford
the most convenient opportunities for the display of accomplishments.</p>

<p class='c000'>The "meet" took place at nine o'clock precisely, and a better
"room" could not be desired.</p>

<p class='c000'>As each member of the Hunt keeps her own harriers at "Walk,"
the first Meeting is always interesting from the number of new
"drafts." In addition, therefore, to those harriers that hunted
last season, with all of whom you are well acquainted, the following
new entries were made:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Lady Browbeater's Lucy Jane; "too short in the head," to my
fancy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Hon. Mrs. Rattletrap's Julia Rose; a lively creature, and
"gives tongue" beautifully.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Major Fubbs's Clementina Louisa; very dumpy and dull—sure
to be "latter'd."</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. General Rowdedow's Lucidora; all that heart could wish—fine
nose, capital mouth, splendid chest, and a forehand and arm
of perfect symmetry.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were one or two others introduced during the evening, but
none of them possessed the necessary qualifications for the Belgrave
Square Harriers. "The beaters" upon this occasion had been my
brother Charles, whose Captaincy, by purchase, depends upon my
being eligibly married off papa's hands; young Musparrot, similarly
circumstanced; and old Major Muggs with four daughters,
aged respectively twenty-six, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, and thirty.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>THE HEIR-PRESUMPTIVE OF GREASE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>They had great fears at one time that our first
meet would prove "blank," as they had beat
up all the clubs during September and October
without "pricking" an Heir either apparent or
presumptive. Major Muggs had the good fortune
to hit upon a track at last, and a finer
specimen I never saw during my short experience.
Five feet eleven, Roman nose,
D'Orsay whiskers, and said to be worth twelve
thousand a year when of age in January next.
He was found lying in some elegantly furnished
apartments in the Albany, sitting on a beautiful
form of velvet. As soon as he made his
appearance in the enclosure at Lady Hurtleberry's
the pack was laid on. Amelia Frog-morton
"challenged" first; I, you may be sure,
was not slow in answering her.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Heir first made for a <em>Polka Quadrille</em>,
closely waited on by Amelia, with myself for
a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vis-à-vis</span></i>. Having got as far as <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pastorale</span></i>,
he "doubled" round by the piano, Mary Warbleton having "turned
him" by Jenny Lind's <em>Ran tan plan</em>, from <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Il Figlia del Regimento</span></i>.
He then "took away" to the card room, but being "headed" by my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>brother Charles, who was purposely stationed in the doorway, he
made for the harp, where I pressed him very hard with <em>Bochsa's
Fancies</em>. He doubled again, and ran straight to the supper-room,
closely followed by the entire pack, but the champagne coming on
pretty briskly, Lady Hurtleberry thought it right to "call us off"
for the evening, the Heir being ultimately bagged by the Major and
Musparrot, and carried to the —— Club; for what purpose I
leave you to guess. The Heir has been "turned down" twice
since, and already shows symptoms of distress. I have not the
least doubt that in a short time longer, <em>I</em>, yes <em>I</em>, my dear Eliza,
shall have the pleasure (but this is <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entre nous</span></i>) of introducing you
to a real juggled heir.</p>

<p class='c000'>By-the-bye, I must send you a copy of a song written by that

<h3 class='c007'>THE LANGUAGE OF VEGETABLES.</h3>

<p class='c008'>We do not think there is in the whole history of letters anything
more beautiful than the two following specimens. Any one acquainted
with the vegetable vocabulary cannot fail to be touched
deeply by them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first was addressed to Sigismond by his devoted wife Toot-sichfootsich,
when he was imprisoned by Kalbskopf II. in the impregnable
fortress of Dummerkerl, in the Spitzbübe mountains, in
Moldavia.</p>

<p class='c000'>The originals, and the monuments of Sigismond's wonderful
escape, are still preserved, with the greatest reverence, by the proud
descendants of his wife's noble family. Admirers of conjugal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>affection have been known to journey to the Spitzbübe Mountains
purposely to look at them. The first letter was scratched with a
pin on a large cabbage leaf, and sent into the castle wrapped round a
pound of butter:—</p>

<p class='c000'>"Beloved Greens!—Dry thy Onions. There is Cabbage in
the horizon. Suppress thy Spinage, there's a darling Bean. Support
thy Haricots with Beetroot, and never let young Radish leave
thy dear Asparagus. May Pickled Gherkins watch over thee, and
Early Peas strew Mashed Potatoes, with Blessed Chickweed, over
thy suffering Turniptop! Where is thy boastod Sourkrout? Have
a little Brocoli, my own sweet Bean; and put thy Chickweed in
Parsley. There is Tomata yet for both of us, so pray hide thy
Cauliflower for a few short Sprouts, and Capers must soon be ours!
Confide in Mangel-würzel. I enclose thee a hundred Greens from
the bottom of my Green Stuff, and remain, my fondest Beetroot,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"<span class='sc'>Thy own dear Marrowfat</span>."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The answer, though in a humbler strain, was not less eloquent.
It was rolled up in little crumbs of bread, which were made into
the shape of pills, and thrown out of the prisoner's window:—</p>

<p class='c000'>"My sweetest Marrowfat!—My Asparagus is well nigh bursting.
My Salad is overflowing, and I cannot rest at night from too much
Mustard seed. Send me, an thou hopest hereafter for Asparagus,
a Scarlet-Runner, and a small Cow Cabbage. Trust in Sage, and
throw thyself fondly on Watercress.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"<span class='sc'>Thy unfortunate Greens.</span>"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/i_326.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The Scarlet-Runner, which is the vegetable emblem for a file,
was hidden in the heel of a boot, and the Cow Cabbage, which
is the beautiful synonym for a rope, smuggled in to the poor prisoner
through a large German sausage, of which he was passionately
fond. He escaped that
very night, and repaid
with the affection of a
whole life the devotion of
his attached "Marrowfat,"
that is to say his wife; we
do not give a translation of
these memorable letters,
as we wish our readers to
refer to the Language of
Vegetables itself; for we
feel it is so fascinating a
science that when once
they go into it, they will
not leave a single vegetable
unturned till they have
got to the root of every
word.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>IF,<br /> !!!AND???</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>If marriages are made in heaven, what a pity the happy pair
should leave the place directly, upon a mere matter of ceremony!</p>

<p class='c000'>If thou stoodest outside the door, thy hand upon the handle, hast
thou ever paused to arrange thy curls, and to pull up thy collar,
and to inspect first thy wristbands, and then thy boots? If so, thou
hast loved, ay, and madly too.</p>

<p class='c000'>If a good name were purchasable, how few would avail themselves
of the luxury if they had to pay ready money for it!</p>

<p class='c000'>If there is really "luck in odd numbers," we can account for the
curious fact of so many ladies stopping half of their lives at the age
of thirty-nine.</p>

<p class='c000'>If two is company, and three is none, what a very melancholy
time old Cerberus must have of it!</p>

<p class='c000'>If "distance lends enchantment to the view," then the British
Drama ought to hold out to speculators the most enchanting views
in the world, for never were its prospects so distant as at the present
moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>If Napoleon had won the battle of Waterloo, Gomersal must have
died comparatively unknown.</p>

<p class='c000'>If man and wife had a plate glass to their hearts, how long would
they remain together?</p>

<p class='c000'>If soda-water had only been known in the time of Alexander, it
is but fair to conclude that the murder of Clytus never would have
taken place.</p>

<p class='c000'>If England were to be divided to-morrow morning equally among
all its inhabitants, we should not like to be the man whose dismal
lot for life turned out to be Trafalgar Square!</p>

<p class='c000'>If Janus really had two faces, we deeply pity him, if he ever
drank a tumbler of Vauxhall punch, for he must have had the following
morning two headaches instead of one!</p>

<p class='c000'>If animals could speak, we can imagine the first words a donkey
would address to man would be "<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Et tu brute</span></i>."</p>

<p class='c000'>If there were no "if's" in the world, there would be no arguments;
no rules of three; no political economy; no more ingenious speculations
about the fate of Europe <em>if</em> England had lost the battle of
Waterloo (<em>if</em> it had, several shareholders would never have lost
their money on Waterloo Bridge, by-the-bye); no more letters from
Joseph Ady about certain valuable information <em>if</em> a sovereign is
sent by return of post; no more liberal promises from fathers as to
what they will do if their sons will only improve, and keep good
hours; no more financial experiments (Sir Robert Peel's scheme
for the income-tax was only one elongated "if," and its repeal is a
still more extended one); and lastly, this clever little article upon
"if's" never would have been written, <em>if</em> there had been no such
word in the language as "if."</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Tom</span>, my boy, how are you? Precious slack
here, I can tell you; business never was
so dull. I haven't had an Atrocious Murder
on my hands these three months. If
this panic continues I shall be so much
out of practice that I'm blessed if I shall
know how to do a Murder when a good
opportunity occurs. Unless some good
lady has the kindness to kill her husband—(how
fashions change! I can recollect
the time when husbands used to kill their
wives: however, it's all the same)—I must
starve, without having the chance either
of making a penny by my own death. By-the-bye,
I have had serious ideas lately of
committing an "Awful Suicide"—don't be startled, I mean only in
the papers. I have reckoned it up, and find that I should make
nearly a sovereign by it—a temptation, my tulip, in these times, and
well worth an imaginary duck in the Thames.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now I know, Tom, this would be unprofessional, but really in
times like these, when a capital execution scarcely turns up once
a year, it doesn't do for a person to be over nice; besides, if I do
extinguish my vital spark for six days, where's the great harm?
Not a person sustains the slightest injury; I have no relations to
blackguard me afterwards for not dying. I have no heirs to sue
the paper for damages; I have no grandmothers to be hurried into
an early grave by the intelligence; and I get a week's dinners by
dying at a time I was never more puzzled how to live. My table,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>I can assure you, has not groaned under the luxuries of the season
for ever so long. So where is the great sin of leaving this sublunary
sphere for seven days, if I cannot keep soul and body together without
it? Psha! it's all affectation, and I have a good mind to try
an Awful Suicide to-morrow; and, to make it more interesting, call
myself "a Gentleman of Fortune." All this scarcity comes of educating
people, and the march of intellect, and the rage for improvements!
Did you ever hear such nonsense? Why, I suppose
civilization will be taking such rapid strides that the wood pavement—(I
hope you have got one in your place; the bit of wood in
the Strand lit my fires for two winters running: what a field it
was for accidents, to be sure! I used to pick up two a day)—will
be cut eventually from under our feet, and we shan't have a bit of
orange-peel, or a slide even, to stand upon, or as much as a drop of
prussic-acid to warm our hearts with before going to bed of a cold
night. It's all a mistake; and if I am a victim to it I shall lay
my death at the door of civilization, and charge them with it. Why,
the cabs are nothing to what they used to be—they wont upset;
and I do really believe the omnibus conductors are getting civil,
merely to spite us. The lightning conductors, too, are very little
better. I haven't been able to drink your health in a drop of electric
fluid for many a day. Where it will end none of us can tell.
The steamers have done a little for business, it's true, and I expect
they will do a great deal more for us; but what, I ask you, is a
<em>Cricket</em> amongst so many? Besides, one doesn't get such a good
blow-out every day. Education, I see, will be the ruin of us all. I
have serious thoughts of turning an informer, and reporting my
own cases; or, if it comes to the worst, of going over to Dublin, and
stopping there patiently till the row at Conciliation Hall begins. I
wish it would take place to-morrow! They are a long time about
it for Irishmen; for the winter is coming on, and I must give up
all thoughts of coals, unless I get a good Destructive Fire or two.
Candles, too, come dear when you cannot find, search where you
will, the smallest bit of Seasonable Benevolence to pay for them.
There's only Railways left us. Do you know, I drink the health of
that dear Eastern Counties every time I am lucky enough to get
an Awful Accident out of it. Why, Tom, my boy, I was only
thinking this morning, as I was leaning over London Bridge, hoping
an ill wind would blow me something good, that I would start a
railway, and so make my own Accidents, and write them, for greater
accuracy, on the spot. I might contract with the different papers
to supply them cheap all the year round. But then I recollected,
and a burning tear bedewed my eye, that that line of luck was all
over, that the poor stags were fairly run off their legs, and that an
end had been put for ever to Capel Court. Twelve months sooner,
and the thing might have been done. I only wish I was in Hudson's
shoes, that's all. What a deal of money I would make, 'lining—wouldn't
I, just!</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, Tom, I must leave you. The neighborhood has just been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>thrown into the greatest consternation by an "Enormous Gooseberry."
I run to measure it with an India-rubber band, for that
stretches the best. I hope it is a crammer; at all events I must
make it large enough to serve me for dinner, and leave me something
to fill my pipe with afterwards. Good-bye, Tom. I hope
Liverpool (you lucky fellow, you had the Fever all last winter; you
ought to have made your fortune, too, with the Irish) is better off
in Accidents—it is much richer I know in Fires—than London. If
not, I will make this agreement with you: you shall have my Inhuman
Neglect by the Parish Authorities, if you bequeath me your
Awful Death by Starvation. Is that a bargain?</p>

  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/i_331di.jpg' width='200' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi1'>
<span class='sc'>A drizzling</span> mist begins to fall. The clock of
St. Clement's strikes seven. A November fog
lowers its invidious veil over the bright face of
London. I hurry on, impatient to listen to the
rival strains of the cricket and kettle, who, I know
from a mysterious singing in my ears, are gaily
carolling on my hearth in Clare Market. "There
is no place like home!"</p>

<p class='c000'>With these thoughts I redouble my speed, even
as the jaded cab-horse quickens his broken knees
when he sees in his mind's eye, through distant
streets, the door of the livery stable. The fog has
the thickness of repeated blankets. It is no light
task for a blind dame to thread a needle in the
dark. That task, however, is as light as the sun
with 20,000 additional lamps on its birthday, compared
to the difficulty of threading Temple Bar in
a fog! But patience, like the boy Jones, will get
through anything.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have shaken off the mud of the city: I breathe
the balmy smoke of Westminster. My high-low,
or rather my high-lows (for I have two) heat once more the proud Strand. I
pass the antique apple-woman on my left; on my right I leave Holloway
and his far-famed leg of twenty years' standing—that Wandering Jew of
advertisements which is perpetually running through the papers. I drop a
sympathetic pill to the memory of Aldborough. Proud Earl! Never did
mortal lay the flattering ointment to his soul as thou hast done! I hurry
onward.</p>

<p class='c000'>But what fragrant perfume, stolen or strayed from Araby the Blest, plays
round my nostrils? It cannot be the fog, for it is so like stewed eels. It
salutes my nose with all the warmth of a long-absent friend. I follow it, as
Hamlet did the Ghost. An invisible attraction pulls me gently on, even as
the magnetic duck which a child leads where he will by applying a load-stone
to its nasal organ. I neither see, nor feel, nor hear; I only smell.
My whole nature is standing on the bridge of my nose. How blind is man!
In my ardour I have nearly upset a respectable stranger: I beg his most
unadulterated pardon a hundredfold; but he heeds me not. A rich necklace
of pies, Twickenham's fairest jewellery, dazzles his weak vision, and fastens,
as with a golden hook, all his eyes. He is under a Savory spell, longing for
More. A hundred appetites glisten from his cavernous brows. Epicurus
and Dando seem to have chosen his high cheek-bones for their respective
thrones. His mouth opens and shuts a thousand times, just like the Strand
Theatre opposite; but, alas! takes in nothing by each new motion. Hunger
could not well have spared a leaner Frenchman. Poor Monsieur! I have
disturbed thy joyous reverie, and would fain make amends for it. "Here is
sixpence to buy thyself luscious pies, freighted with all the boundless wealth
of the generous eel." But he is as deaf as a relation that is rich. His
thoughts are seated at the rich banquet within.</p>

<hr class='c019' />

<p class='c000'>The parish engine is pulled along by a lusty beadle, like an invalid chair
at Brighton by one of the plethoric Sons of Plush. Six little boys subscribe
their voices and their strength, but there is more of the former than the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>latter. There is merriment in Drury Lane; loud cries of "Fire" play gaily
upon the ear. Even a policeman—that rarest object of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vertu</span></i>—is seen. He
illuminates for two seconds the busy scene with the "light in his laughing
eye" of bull. The fire-escape is unrolled, like a tall mummy, from its dark
slumber of ages, and stretches its spider limbs high into the air as it yawns
again into life. It crawls, like a centipede on its hind leg, as far as Temple
Bar, and there draws itself up, like a big note of exclamation, and makes a
full stop. Peradventure it reaches the fire three days afterwards. There is
a time for all things.</p>

<p class='c000'>But whose is that ecstatic figure? It is as familiar to my vision as
Cooper in George Barnwell. Who can it be? Yes—no—yes! It cannot
be! By St. Jullien, it is the dismal Child of France! The clock of St.
Clement's strikes ten. What! Monsieur, hast thou for three foggy hours
been poring over those self-same pies? Thy admiration smacks, methinks,
of the bigot. Thou art indeed an enthusiast. Hie thee to Soyer! Catch
him between a poem and a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pâté</span></i>, bursting with the richest stuffing of the
goose—I mean the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pâté</span></i>. Perform the same rites before his household pans
of stew; let thy every limb speak thy admiration, and my head of hair,
bought but yesterday at Truefitt's, he will give thee, for half such prodigal
worship, thy weight in pies, be they of gooseberry or mutton, or the ham
and veal dedicated to Thespis, or even the delicate eel, the dear object of
thy silent love! Concealment has indeed fed upon thy damask cheek, and
picked it—would I could say clean!—to the bone. "<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voici, mon Noble
Seigneur, de quoi te régaler.</span></i>" He sees not the proffered Joseph; he hears
not my tones, sweet with charity. He stirs not: he stands on holy pavement.
Poor Frenchman, I would tarry with thee, but I must rush me home
to supper. Haven't I tripe waiting kindly for me! My clay, too, points to
heavy wet; and my pewter will lose its head if I am not quickly with it.
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adieu.</span></i></p>

<p class='c000'>Night has spread its shutters over London. All is still, save a spirituous
cry of "Va-<em>ri</em>-e-ty," that comes at muffled intervals leaping through the air.
There is not a Gent to be seen. Even Lord Ellam has retired to his bed
under the ducal counter. Sleep snores heavily in the Strand, and the nightmare
rules in the City. All humanity, save editors and milkmen, is between
the sheets.</p>

<p class='c000'>All, did I say? It is false. There is one figure still, very still, on its
legs. He is no purveyor of chalk, or human kindness. He is not a thief
either, save one of Time; and better to rob him than Rogers' bank,—though,
it is true, the notes may be stopped, but the minutes, alas! never.
Whose is that figure? Egad! It is the Frenchman's.</p>

<p class='c000'>There he stands, opposite the same identical emporium. He is wrapt in
mystery and a Spanish cloak, with a collar borrowed from the poodle. He
has not moved the whisper of a pig to the right or to the left. What fearful
secret can chain him to that awful spot?</p>

<p class='c000'>His iron glances seem as if they would pierce like nails at tenpence
a-piece the shutters of that Depôt. The hunger on his countenance is not
yet appeased. I offer him an Havannah, the best that the Green of Turnham
can produce. He answers me only with a sallow smile. No complaint
escapes his lips, though it is clear as Thames water that is filtered that he
is ill at ease. Ah! perhaps he is doing penance for some early crime?
Perhaps it is a vow he has registered in some album to please his Love?
Perhaps—but I waste the valuable ink of the printer with these idle sur-mises;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>be the awful cause what it will, from the bottom of my purse, noble
stranger from the noble Land of the <em>Cancan</em>, I do feel for thee! Thou
wouldst never remain outside a piscatorial pastrycook's for nine long hours,

<p>THE SPIRIT LEVEL.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I cannot sleep. My pillow is burning hot. Fever shares my bed.
The vision of that unhappy Frenchman keeps pulling aside the
curtains, and crying aloud in my ear, "Curiosity doth murder
sleep." It is too true! Who can close his eyes, though they be
weighed down with two bottles of port, of the best Public Dinner
vintage, and sealed with the
smoke of three-times-ten
cigars, when he has a secret
gnawing at his heart? I
don my morning suit, and
walk breathless, breakfastless
to the Strand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Clerks are plodding to their high stools in the City. All waistcoats are
turned towards St. Paul's. Omnibuses are laden with cashiers—strict
lovers of punctuality—who eat, and drink, and sleep, and make love, by the
chronometer. The antique apple-woman is putting on her great coat, the
relic of her late relict, a deceased cabman. Holloway determines to have an
immense spread, and lays down a roll of ointment eight yards without a
seam. Newspaper boys sing in quires as they canter along with wet
bundles under their arms. The sun rises; the puddles reflect its golden
smiles; the cocks and hens visit their daily cab-stand; the postman's knock
is heard; the clock of St. Clement's strikes nine. London has begun a new
day.</p>

<p class='c000'>But what are these facts to me? No more than Spanish Bonds, for I do
not even look at them. I have but one object in view, and that is the
Frenchman.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_333b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>But the cloak has disappeared, and the person inside it. His penance
doubtless, is at an end—his humble vow fulfilled. He is gone: but, how
strange! he has left his boots behind
him. There they stand, in the middle
of the pavement, bolt upright—one a
Blucher, its companion a Wellington—as
if they had risen out of the coal-cellar
over night, like a couple of
mushrooms. A phantom policeman
attempts to take them up, but they
are riveted to the spot. But, see!
the poor exile comes this way: slippers
are on his feet. He claims his
boots. "Take them," says the man
of law, bound in blue, and lettered
B 32. No! They will not stir. He
pulls them with a pair of boot-hooks,
but if there were a Woman's Obstinacy
in each sole, they could not
maintain their ground more stoutly.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>A pickaxe is brought. The boots are pulled up at length, but in company
with the flag-stone. They are carried on the latter, as on a tray, before the
magistrate. Their disconsolate owner follows them in his slippers. He
unfolds his simple unadorned tale of woe. First he identifies the boots.
The name of "<em>Marquis de Carambole</em>" appears inside each. Next he states
he had been giving a lesson in French for sixpence to a family in the Lane
of Leather. On his way home he stopped to admire some pies arrayed most
temptingly in a sumptuous window. He tarried longer than he intended,
but the luxury of the sight beguiled away the unconscious moments. He
felt his feet getting very warm, but he thought it was only the grateful
steam of the shop. He still looked on, turning over the sixpence alternately
in his mind and in his pocket, whether he should spend it, or keep it to have
his hair curled. At last he resolved on the rash purchase. He attempted
to move, but his right foot was fastened to the pavement, and his left foot
too; he was motionless; he was literally screwed—he had grown to the
ground. He was riveted to the spot, not only in admiration, but in positive
reality. For four interminable hours he endured worse than the torture of
Tantalus, for eel pies were not known in the dark ages of Pluto. A feast
was before him which he could not touch. Twelve o'clock at last put a
friendly termination to his sufferings: the shop closed. He was left in the
streets of London all by himself. He felt cold. His feet were benumbed,
but he could not do anything to keep them warm. Stamping was out of the
question, for he could not even lift them. A policeman told him once to
"move on," but unfortunately he came like a shadow, and so departed. He
thought of his landlord, of his tailor, of his washerwoman, of everything that
was dear to him. A tear washed his cheek. He trembled like a creditor.
He did not like to shout for aid, his position was so very ridiculous. At last
necessity, the coldest he ever experienced, conquered his vanity. He cut
his straps, and ran away like a second Napoleon, leaving Wellington and
Blucher masters of the field. Having finished, the poor Orphan of France
demands, in a voice of tears, that his boots may be restored to him.</p>

<p>THE APPROACH OF BLUCHER.—INTREPID ADVANCE OF THE FIRST FOOT.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>"Certainly," says the urbane magistrate; "but you must first pay for the
damage you have done to the pavement."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>The poor Frenchman pleads that it is not his fault; but his plea is as
bootless as himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>A policeman, with the bump of science, craves leave to explain the
mystery.</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/i_335.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Leave is given to him; and, clearing his throat, he speaks thus:—"I
think I can tell, sir, what is the mystery at the bottom of all this. It is
Gutta Percha. This Gutta Percha, sir, is a new material of a waterproof
substance; at first soluble, which afterwards hardens, and resists the action
of water. It is used largely for boots. It is not proof, however, against
heat. The consequence is that when it is exposed to a great warmth it
becomes adhesive, and very tenacious of the footing it occupies. There is
an instance of a cook whose Irish cousin was warming his feet at the fire;
he had on soles made of Gutta Percha. His boots adhered to the hobs, and
there he stuck in
the kitchen for a
fortnight till a frost
came. It was called
Hobbes' 'Essay on
the Understanding.'"</p>

<p class='c000'>The man of the
oil-skin cape is reprimanded
severely for this joke, and then resumes: "It is
exactly the same scrape with this gentleman, if he will
excuse the liberty I take in calling him so," he said, bowing
to the Frenchman. "The fact is he remained so long
admiring those eel pies that his soul expanded at the sight,
and when he wanted to go he found he could not tear himself
away: the Gutta Percha had become melted with the
heat of the cook-shop, and strapped him to the pavement
like a statue on a pedestal."</p>

<p class='c000'>The mystery was as clear as if it had been strained with
isinglass. The boots were investigated, and lo! the policeman's
words for once were truth. Gutta Percha was at the
bottom of each boot! The spell was solved, and so after a
time were the soles. But let the reader scrutinize closely
the pavement in the Strand; and on the left side, before he comes to
Temple Bar, he will be able to pick out a flag-stone, opposite the "Royal
Emporium for Eel Pies," which has on it the perfect imprint of the soles of
a Blucher and a Wellington. It was on that very bit of granite where the
poor Frenchman stood for nine hours, buffeted by the stream of people that
kept flowing backwards and forwards, and tortured beyond any modern
martyrdom by the tempting feast spread before him, which he could only
devour with his hungry eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of all the new inventions there is not one which is likely to make a firmer
stand, or keep its ground longer, than Gutta Percha.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>THE FEMALE TARS OF GREAT BRITAIN.<br /> FASHIONABLE YACHTING.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The ladies are invading everything. The Stock Exchange, Capel Court,
the field, the lecture-room, the betting-ring—places exclusively devoted
hitherto to black coats and legs of the same colour—have been recently
graced, or disgraced, as the case has been, with the presence the fair, and
sometimes unfair, sex. The clubs, it is true, are still in the hands of men,
and woman, though she has voice enough in laying down the law at home,
has none as yet in Parliament; though we are confident if a handsome
duchess, or Mrs. Nisbett, were only to put up for a county (say Bucks), that
she would no sooner announce her intention of standing, than every Buck in
the borough would rush forward to offer her a seat. Common politeness would
carry her into the House of Commons. Government, however, is not the only
floating and sinking thing that has a helm. Our yachts are open to the
ladies; and, till they can steer the Vessel of State, they are at full liberty to
soil their <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gants de Paris</span></i> in handling the tiller of a Yacht. Are the quick-sands
of office more dangerous to thread than the Needles? And what are
the breezes, and the ups and downs of a parliamentary life, to those of the
ocean? Go, ask Earl Grey, and he will tell you that he would sooner have
fifty berths under Government than one in a royal yacht, any day!</p>

<p class='c000'>The example set by the Queen every year has turned all the ladies mad for a
Yacht. It is customary now, instead of packing up the drawing-room furniture
whilst the family is out of town, to have it carried on board, where it is
fitted up on deck, or does state duty in the cabins. The Turkey carpet covers
the vulgar planks, the bell ropes are substituted for the coarse ropes; and
chairs, richly inlaid with mother-of-pearl, replace the plain lockers. The whole
household is transported generally as well, though apoplectic footmen sometimes
desert after the first day, preferring board wages in May Fair to the best
wages on board, in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following extract from a Lady's Log Book will best illustrate this
new fashion. It is written in the beautifully small handwriting of the enterprising
Lady Augusta Fiddle-Faddle, who sailed in the <em>Jenny Lind</em> on a
cruise to Paris, last October.</p>

<p class='c021'>Sept. 2nd.—Started from Cowes. Sea just like a rocking-horse, up and down,
up and down; not at all pleasant; very giddy; wind blowing all day at my back,
nearly breaking my beautiful ostrich feather; no appetite for dinner; took an
early tea, no muffins, not even a sally-lunn. Gave orders that the French cook (a
promising pupil of Soyer's) might be told "to take good care it didn't occur
again." In bed at eight, very unwell; ordered the rocking of the vessel to be
stopped immediately, but not a soul paid any attention to my sufferings.</p>

<p>YACHTING FOR LADIES—MAYFAIR IN THE MEDITERRANEAN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>3rd.—No new milk for breakfast; told the butler to send for some directly;
the impudent fellow sent word, "that there was no possibility of making Cowes
so soon." Ordered his beer to be stopped. Dreadful noise overhead. Told
Adolphus to inquire what it was. The intelligent lad brought me intelligence that
it was the housemaid sweeping the carpets on deck. Went upstairs, and asked
the reason why the deck was not ready before twelve o'clock. Told Jane and
Maria Louisa that I would have the strictest discipline maintained in my Yacht,
or else they had better suit themselves at once with other situations. Superintended
the dusting of the ottomans, and reprimanded John Thomas for going up
the dirty ropes without his Berlin gloves on. Detected a faint smell of tar, and
ordered the carpet to be sprinkled with eau-de-Cologne, and feathers to be burnt
in every room in the Yacht. Threw my glove over the railing of the vessel to see
which way the wind blew; but on its going straight down and sinking very rapidly
recollected that my purse was inside. A thorough draft arising at that moment
blew off my <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fichu</span></i> towards the right, and proved beyond a doubt that the wind was
in a straight line to Brighton. Determined to go there, and told the coachman
in charge of the Yacht to make as much haste as possible, as I wished to make a
morning call on Lady Bandury Bunn, who was staying there, with all her little
Bunns. It turned out, however, towards four o'clock, that we were not many
hundred yards' distance from Havre; but as I had not a French bonnet with me
I declined going on shore. In the evening, a ball, and I played a small concertina
(I had brought with me to charm the dolphins), to enable the poor servants to
dance. John Thomas and Jane Hussey went through a hornpipe as well as the
uneven state of the Yacht would allow them. Served out tea and sugar at eight.
Towards nine there was a very strong smell of tobacco; searched the Yacht,
escorted by Adolphus, who carried two wax candles before me; we found the smell
proceeded from the servants' hall. Descended the narrow staircase cautiously, and
surprised, in the pantry, the butler, John Thomas, and the French cook, each
smoking with the window open, what is called, I believe, a pipe. Ordered these
offensive articles to be seized, and to be instantly thrown into the lowest depths of
the sea; and did not retire to rest before my orders were strictly executed.
Looked into the housekeeper's room, and gave directions for a muslin cover to be
made for the gold Cupid that holds the compass; if I am correct in so terming the
long darning-needle that is kept under a glass shade.</p>

<p class='c021'>4th.—Wind very fair to-day. Curled my hair for the first time in ringlets.
Inspected some Valenciennes lace I have bought, a perfect bargain, of a French
smuggler; it will look well on a velvet dress. Told John to drive direct to Paris.
The insolent fellow asked "if I would go by Brussels, or did I prefer Vienna?"
Gave him instantly warning. He turned the vessel round with its head towards
London. Told him that was not the road to Paris, when he said he "was going
back to Southampton to suit himself with another place." Rang the bell, and
told Grisetta to tell all the servants to come upstairs. The poor girl only speaking
French, the stupid servants, who worry my life out, did not understand her.
Directed my page Adolphus to summon the butler before me. Mr. Smithers appeared
with his hat on; I asked him how he dared to appear in my presence with
his head covered? His answer was, "that he had had two wigs blown off already,
and he had caught a violent cold in his head." Asked him "What was his cold
in the head when the discipline of the ship was at stake?" and he could not answer
a word. Told him I should report him to Sir Valentine as soon as we landed in
Grosvenor Square. Being determined to punish the coachman, ordered him to
leave the box, and took the whip out of his hand in the presence of my maid and
the German governess. The menial coloured, and to make his degradation the
more striking, I pulled the cockade off his hat. I then took the what-d'ye-call-it,
the long pole that pushes the vessel along, and attempted to guide it. The
fatigue, however, was too much for my wrists, and I split my gloves in the
exertion; was afraid, besides, of turning the vessel upside down, but disguised my
fears before the dependents. Left the pole, and picked my way down to the
servants' hall. Found the servants, male and female, at dinner, the butler in the
chair, and Mrs. Bantam, the housekeeper, at the bottom. Apologized for intruding,
for I thought it was best to be civil. Spoke kindly, and told them to serve
me properly, and their rations of tea and sugar should be doubled. Mrs. Bantam
thanked me. Then told them that "a great act of insubordination had been
shown by the coachman above, and that I had been obliged to strip him"—(Here
I paused to take note of the effect of my words; but no sympathy was, I am glad
to say, evinced)—"of his situation." I reminded them of their duties, and conjured
them to be faithful to their mistress, and they should not repent it when
their wages were paid; but I told them plainly, if they coalesced with the coachman
it should be as much as their situations were worth. If any one of them was
displeased, and thought herself ill-used, or out of her proper element, she
might leave the ship that instant, and I would be the last person to prevent
her bettering herself. Not one amongst them took me at my word, and I was
pleased more than I can express at their fidelity. I told them as much, and
confessed I had anticipated a mutiny, but had made up my mind fully how to
act in case the smallest <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soupçon</span></i> of treachery had declared itself. "I would have
opened the plugs at the bottom of the yacht," I said loudly to them, "and we
should have all sunk together, after I had taken the precaution to write a letter
to the <cite>Times</cite>, in which every one of your names would have been reported at full
length, with your christian names and ages." I was going on in the most eloquent
strain, when the most dreadful thumping occurred to the ship, and there
was a noise overhead such as I had never heard before, even at one of Verdi's
operas. I nearly fainted, for I thought a whale had run against us, and had
burst in one of our panels; but a young footman, who had run upstairs and down
again whilst I was losing my colour, assured me it was only the bowsprit (for so
he called the long pole which protrudes from the front of the vessel) which had
been shattered to pieces in consequence of its coming in collision with Southampton
Pier, which happened at that moment to be in the way. I then recollected
that I had left no one in charge of the Yacht, and hastened upstairs. I
found a Custom-House officer coming up the rope ladder by the side, and gave
the coachman into custody for having violated the laws of his country. The man
searched him, and said, with the greatest <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nonchalance</span></i>, that there was nothing
about him that warranted his detaining him. He then asked me if I had anything
to declare. "Anything to declare?" I said. "Yes, I declare that your
conduct is the greatest piece of impertinence I have ever heard of;" and I went on
in a great passion for a long time. The man got very angry, and I had a very
good mind to have him thrown into the sea for his insolence; but I conquered
my pride, for at that moment Prince FitzunStartz, the young Bohemian nobleman
who first brought over the polka, came tripping on the yacht, and I was
too glad, in order to escape, to take his arm, though he had just been smoking.
I recounted to him the dangers I had gone through, and he would have it I
was "quizzing" him, just as if I was likely to joke upon such a matter of
life and death. We had scarcely reached the end of the pier when an officer
stopped us, and informed me that the <em>Jenny Lind</em> was seized by the Custom
House authorities for having on board a quantity of smuggled goods. Oh dear!
oh dear! that Valenciennes will cost me dearer than what I might have got
it for at Howell and James's, and they wouldn't have asked me for the money for
six years to come at least; whereas I paid that smuggler every bit in sovereigns.
Oh! that stupid Yacht!</p>

<h3 class='c007'>MOVEMENT OF THE FINE ARTS.</h3>

<p class='c008'>The Fine Arts are seized at present with a strange movement;
they are all going backwards. One would fancy they were retreating,
or that they had lost something on the road, and were turning
back to pick it up. We scarcely imagine
it was worth while going out of their
way to embrace the Middle Ages; it
shows but little taste on their part.
They might as well dress in the costume
of that period, and wear Gothic night-caps,
and mediæval high-lows, and talk,
and write, and flirt in the language of
that period, as to attempt to reconcile
its hard angular painting (all their pictures
look to us like coloured problems—as
if Euclid had been their drawing-master)
to the spirit of our own times.
Imagine portraits of the heroes of the
present age in the stiff kitchen-poker
style which Messrs. Pugin, Dyce, and
such like retrograders, would wish to
revive! How would the immortal
Simpson look? How would the popular
Jim Crow appear to us, when carried
two hundred years back? Why! we
should not know them again.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_343b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps this going backwards is for
the purpose of enabling the artists to jump farther onwards, as the
French proverb says, "<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Reculer
pour mieux sauter</span></i>;" or
is it to make the Fine Arts
so much younger, by knocking
some three hundred
years off their age? We always
thought that art was
of no particular period, but
for all time. Antiquated ladies
may gain by the above
process of youth-making,
and we can imagine in our
own mind's ear (if the mind
has an eye it must have an
ear) a very old man saying,
"Ah! I wish I could go back to the Middle Age!"
but really the Fine Arts should be above such weakness. This
love of going backward may account, perhaps, for so few artists
getting forward in their profession. Let them turn their backs
upon the past, and the future may smile brightly again upon
them. The English school of painting will not stand long, if it is
built with old materials; some four hundred years old.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>'Tis boxing night—every theatre is crammed,</div>
      <div class='line'>As close as a jelly the people are jammed;</div>
      <div class='line'>Every corner is full from the roof to the floor,</div>
      <div class='line'>And money is being refused at the door.</div>
      <div class='line'>The play of George Barnwell is being gone through,</div>
      <div class='line'>'Mid the usual regular hullabaloo.</div>
      <div class='line'>A middle-aged actor appears on the scene,</div>

      <div class='line'>The old boy of forty looks something like twenty.</div>
      <div class='line'>But our sympathies, somehow, he doesn't engage,</div>
      <div class='line'>He's laughed at whenever he comes on the stage;</div>
      <div class='line'>His uncle they wont let him murder in peace,</div>
      <div class='line'>But the incident causes a cry of "police."</div>
      <div class='line'>The uncle elicits no pity at all,</div>
      <div class='line'>For shouts of rude merriment follow his fall;</div>
      <div class='line'>And when his assassin has killed him outright,</div>
      <div class='line'>Some "wag" in the gallery bids him "good night."</div>
      <div class='line'>The pathos of Trueman, though good of its sort,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is met with proposals for cutting it short;</div>
      <div class='line'>And Barnwell goes off to be hanged 'mid a cry</div>
      <div class='line'>Of "shame," "turn him out," "serve him right" and "good-bye."</div>
      <div class='line'>The pantomime now is awaited by all;</div>
      <div class='line'>The house for the overture raises a call;</div>
      <div class='line'>Confusion prevails, bits of orange-peel flit</div>
      <div class='line'>From the gallery's hands to the heads of the pit;</div>
      <div class='line'>The cat-call so loud, and the whistle so shrill,</div>
      <div class='line'>Are blended with shouts such as "Bob, where's your 'Bill!'"</div>
      <div class='line'>At length the musicians have taken their seats,</div>
      <div class='line'>The leader a lamp with his fiddle-stick beats;</div>
      <div class='line'>Such silences ensues that the dropping of pins</div>
      <div class='line'>Might be heard through the house when the playing begins.</div>
      <div class='line'>The overture's always a musical salad,</div>
      <div class='line'>A mixture of Polka, Cachuca, and ballad:</div>
      <div class='line'>If the season has furnished a popular air,</div>
      <div class='line'>The ear that is ticklish will meet with it there.</div>
      <div class='line'>The taste of the public will often insist on</div>
      <div class='line'>A <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">solo</span></i> for trumpet or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cornet-à-piston</span></i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which, played well or ill, from the audience draws,</div>
      <div class='line'>At Christmas, a general round of applause;</div>
      <div class='line'>During holiday time you can never do wrong</div>
      <div class='line'>If even a passage you gave to the gong,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or formed a quartette most delicious and tender,</div>
      <div class='line'>With poker, and shovel, and tongs, and the fender.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>The overture's finished, the curtain's ascended,</div>
      <div class='line'>A scene is before us exceedingly splendid.</div>
      <div class='line'>A lovely princess is reduced to despair</div>
      <div class='line'>At long being wooed by a man she can't bear,</div>
      <div class='line'>A wretch in a mask with inelegant features,</div>
      <div class='line'>That are found nowhere else but in pantomime creatures;</div>
      <div class='line'>But after the lady there constantly dangles</div>
      <div class='line'>A youth whose thin calves are bedizened with spangles;</div>
      <div class='line'>For under his cloak his legs we discover,</div>
      <div class='line'>And "afterwards harlequin" peeps through the lover.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Of course the princess has a father severe,</div>
      <div class='line'>With a mouth quite extending from ear unto ear;</div>
      <div class='line'>His head is terrific, and, monstrous surprise,</div>
      <div class='line'>If you look down his mouth you'll distinguish his eyes.</div>
      <div class='line'>And as to his voice, if its source you should trace,</div>
      <div class='line'>You'll find it proceeds from a very odd place—</div>
      <div class='line'>A sort of incision just under his chin,</div>
      <div class='line'>Through which he sends forth a most horrible din.</div>
      <div class='line'>The choice of his daughter he does not approve,</div>
      <div class='line'>And nothing the heart of the tyrant will move;</div>
      <div class='line'>The lovers are both to despair giving way,</div>
      <div class='line'>When of splendid machinery there's a display.</div>
      <div class='line'>Some clouds from the stage unexpectedly rise,</div>
      <div class='line'>While a sort of pavilion descends from the flies;</div>
      <div class='line'>But somehow or other, it seems, in the air,</div>
      <div class='line'>Their machine always is out of repair;</div>
      <div class='line'>The clouds make a hitch, and refuse to expand,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or the flying pavilion is brought to a stand.</div>
      <div class='line'>The obstacle soon is surmounted, when straight</div>
      <div class='line'>A fairy appears—the expounder of fate.</div>
      <div class='line'>She bids the fair lady abandon her gloom,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the aspect of columbine quickly assume;</div>
      <div class='line'>At which the princess, being gone to the wing,</div>
      <div class='line'>Has the whole of her dress dragged away by a string;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then in petticoats wondrously short she advances,</div>
      <div class='line'>And gives at the house the most sunny of glances.</div>
      <div class='line'>To the youth in the spangles the fairy next speaks,</div>
      <div class='line'>And bids him of harlequin practise the freaks;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>The shape he assumes, and attention to win,</div>
      <div class='line'>His head he sets off in a wonderful spin—</div>
      <div class='line'>So rapidly twisting and twirling it round,</div>
      <div class='line'>That we wonder it does not drop off on the ground.</div>
      <div class='line'>The father and friend are let loose on the town,</div>
      <div class='line'>As pantaloon one—and the other as clown;</div>
      <div class='line'>A loud "here we are!" gains a general shout,</div>
      <div class='line'>Pantaloon says his mother's aware he is out;</div>
      <div class='line'>And then, 'mid a mutual kicking of shins,</div>
      <div class='line'>The fun of the pantomime fairly begins.</div>
      <div class='line'>Of course there's a baker who's robbed by the clown;</div>
      <div class='line'>Of course there's an image-tray coolly pushed down;</div>
      <div class='line'>Of course there's a baby crushed flat as a flounder;</div>
      <div class='line'>Of course there's a lady with pickpockets round her;</div>
      <div class='line'>Of course there's a pie, and of course (who could doubt of it?)</div>
      <div class='line'>Directly it's opened, live pigeons fly out of it;</div>
      <div class='line'>Of course there's a window, and steadfastly view it,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of course you'll see harlequin neatly jump through it;</div>
      <div class='line'>Of course there's an uproar, and then, to enrich it,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of course there's a clamour for "Tippitywitchet;"</div>
      <div class='line'>Of course it's encored, and, it need not be said,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of course we're indulged with "Hot Codlins" instead;</div>
      <div class='line'>Of course they all meet in the Cave of Despair,</div>
      <div class='line'>And of course no one knows how they ever got there;</div>
      <div class='line'>And of course the last scene is the Realms of Delight,</div>
      <div class='line'>And of course there's a hope that you'll come every night;</div>
      <div class='line'>And of course the kind fairy appears once again,</div>
      <div class='line'>But why, she of course don't attempt to explain;</div>
      <div class='line'>Of course she propitiates "all her kind friends."</div>
      <div class='line'>The curtain then falls, and the pantomime ends.</div>

<h3 class='c007'>THE CITY "FAST MAN."</h3>

<div  class='figleft id008'>
<img src='images/i_349di.jpg' alt='MR.' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Faddle</span> is a distinguished member of
the Stock Exchange, and decidedly
one of the "fastest men" in the City.
He makes his appearance in the City
at about half-past eleven every day;
strolls about the neighbourhood of the Bank,
with his hands in the pockets of his coat-tails;
takes a sandwich at the Auction Mart, or
oysters in Finch Lane; and goes away about
three, with the idea that he has been very
busy. We first met him at the Hanover
Square Rooms. His dress was rather peculiar;
and at the first glance you said (to yourself),
"This is no common man;" and it is
rather singular that the more you knew of
him, the more you became confirmed in that
opinion. His coat was very long in the waist,
with singularly capacious sleeves; his neckcloth
very narrow; and his whiskers a triumph
of art in the curling line. His waistcoat was
considerably larger than any you ever saw,
except on an ostler; his shirt was embroidered
and very transparent, with some pink substance underneath, that
made one fancy he had recently been using the flesh-brush very
vigorously. His trousers were very tight about the legs; and his
boots very tight about the feet. The first remark he made was on
a young lady, who he said was "a good stepper." He next stated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>that he had been at the "Corner" all day: on our inquiring where
that was, he said, with a contemptuous look, "Tattersall's, to be
sure!" He then told us that Lord Levant's "Wide Awake" was a
likely horse for the Leger; and said, if we were doing anything on
it, we had better not lay out our money on Captain Spavin's
"Flare Up." His next inquiry was if we knew Tom Spraggs? and
upon our answering in the negative, he ejaculated, quite loud,
"Don't he drive cattle, that's all?" We fancied at first that Mr.
Spraggs might be a drover, but abandoned the idea in favour of its
being some technical term we did not understand. Here the conversation
flagged, and to resuscitate it we made a remark on Mr.
Faddle's coat-studs, and asked what they were made of? "Teeth,"
he said. "Teeth!" we could not help exclaiming; "what teeth?"
"Why, foxes' teeth, to be sure," he said, turning away with an air
of infinite disgust, and never spoke to us again.</p>

<p class='c000'>We watched him at supper, and found he did not wait on other
people much, but took great care of himself. We heard him offer
to get a spaniel of some extraordinary breed for a young lady; but
he never thought of asking her if she would take anything, though
he was eating all the while himself. His appetite, in fact, was
rather extensive. He partook largely of the substantials, then
addressed himself to the plovers' eggs and lobster salads, and
finished with a deep tankard of beer, which he called "malt."
Later in the evening we thought a strong odour of tobacco pervaded
the hall, and going out we found the "fast man" with a "weed in
his off-cheek," as he elegantly expressed it, just preparing to start.
His dog-cart was at the door, he jumped in, the small tiger (quite
a portable boy) climbed up behind, Mr. Faddle blew a few loud
notes with his post-horn, and we saw him no more.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>AN IMAGINARY RUN ON A TURKISH RAILWAY.</h3>
</div>

<div  class='figleft id008'>
<img src='images/i_351di.jpg' alt='The' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c008'>FORMATION of the new railway
across the Isthmus of Suez is suggestive
of some curious speculation as to
the mode in which business will be conducted
by the Turks, whose tree of
knowledge is rather green upon such
matters, and may get its owners into a
line from which it will not be easy to
extricate themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Lamp of Aladdin, of course, will
be used as a safety signal, and the bow-string (that "great moral
engine" which draws everybody in the East into one common
terminus) as a signal of danger. It is also understood that the
celebrated "Slave of the Ring" will be posted by turns at the
different stations to announce the arrival of the trains; and that in
place of the electric telegraph, the celebrated telescope of Prince
Ali (which beat Lord Rosse's hollow) will be used in conjunction
with the Prince Hassein's carpet to discover accidents and despatch
assistance; while the apple of Prince Ahmed, which cured all diseases,
will be used for the relief of the sufferers. The solemnity of
Eastern manners will have a singular effect among the—to us—every-day
associations connected with railway travelling. We can
fancy a director, on a dividend day, exclaiming, "Holy Profit!"
but we can <em>not</em> fancy the chairman and directors dining together
afterwards at the Bosphorus Blackwall, wherever that may be,
without wine or whitebait, and getting through the gormandizing
process with their fingers. Then, on coming away, what a tedious
process it must be; the finding of the slippers which have been left
in the hall—an annoyance which an English director could imagine
if he had ever been obliged to leave a festive party at the Crown
and Sceptre in a small Wellington and a big Blucher, belonging to
other gentlemen. Of course, the subordinates on the line will be
equally polite with their betters. As a train arrives at a station,
the Oriental guard will rise from his chibouk, and say, with a profound
salaam, "Kosh Amedid! You are welcome!" and express a
hope to the party, Pasha or highly-fed Aga, as they alight from
the first-class carrages, that their respective shadows may never
be less—which, by the way, to men who are wont to indulge in
habitual oxen, stuffed with perpetual pistachio nuts, is rather an
uncharitable wish than otherwise. Then the official will solemnly
approach the second class, and exclaim, "Mashallah, oh ye gents—(there
are doubtless gents in the East)—but are the tickets of
the faithful ready?" and add, on receiving them, "Bishmillah, the
Mare of Mahomet be praised!" To the third class, where the unbelievers
will throng, the expression will be—"Allah is great, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>Mahomet is his Prophet. Dogs of Christians, tickets!" Reversing
the English custom, a carriage must be set apart in every train
for the infidels who do <em>not</em> smoke.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE POTATO ITSELF AGAIN.</h3>

<p class='c008'>We are glad to announce the recovery of the Potato. It has been
too long absent from the festive board, and we are sure its reappearance
at the dinner table will be hailed with all the warmth
of a public friend, whose generous nature enables thousands to keep
the pot boiling all the year round. How rejoiced the Baked Leg
of Mutton will be to embrace its old companion once more! The
two agree so well that they never should be separated. We can
imagine the pans and kettles too, which have been growing rather
rusty in its absence, will now brighten up again at its return, and
bless "its dear eyes," <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la</span></i> T. P. Cooke, to see it looking so well. In
Ireland its recovery will be quite a national feast. The "whole
biling" of them will be, let us hope, in every man's mouth. In
England, also, it will be a guest everywhere, from the palace to the
potato-can. England is proud of its Champion; and justly—for no
Champion strips so quickly for his rounds as the Potato. May it
never leave us again! We could well spare a better vegetable.</p>

<p class='c000'>He may be seen in a stall inside a theatre, but not at a stall outside

<p class='c000'>He may dust another person's jacket, but mustn't brush his own.</p>

<p class='c000'>He must pay his debts of honour, but he needn't trouble himself about

<p class='c000'>He may drive a stage-coach, but he mustn't take or carry coppers.</p>

<p class='c000'>He may ride a horse as a jockey, but he mustn't exert himself in the

<h3 class='c007'>SHIRTICULTURE.</h3>

<p class='c008'>A new branch of the Fine Arts has lately flourished, which we do not
know how to designate by any better name than <span class='sc'>Shirticulture</span>. It is
the art of painting on shirts—an art which
cannot fail to go to the bosom of every one
who enters at all into it. It was a
favourite maxim of Buffon, that "<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le style c'est
l'homme</span></i>." With all due respect to one who
dressed animals in the finest language, we beg
to say, that nowadays "<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La chemise c'est
l'homme</span></i>." The shirt is the man. Depend upon
it, that shortly the particular profession, trade,
penchant, or weakness of every one, will be laid
bare to the whole world upon his breast. The
gent has nearest to his heart a ballet-girl; and
the sportsman is immediately detected by the
last winner of the Derby peeping through his
"Dickey." The noble game of cricket has been
got up on a piece of lawn, no bigger than
your chest; and we have seen Jack Sheppard
breaking through a publican's shirt-front. Rowing
matches not unfrequently run down the
back of a river swell; and we know a gentleman who never appears on
the turf without a whole steeple-chase galloping
right over him, with a tremendous hunter
jumping over each shoulder. The rage for
pictorial shirts will ultimately spread over
everybody in the kingdom. Men of noble
descent will be drawing out their genealogical
tree on a square of fine calico; and admirers
of the "Fancy" will be putting their pet
bull-dogs into muslin. We shall have heraldic
shirts, theatrical shirts, military shirts, archæological
and antiquarian shirts, temperance and
convivial shirts, and shirts with portraits of
puppy-dogs, men, parrots, and women. We
shall have artists in shirts, as we have artists
in hair; and every washerwoman's drying-ground
will be an exhibition, to which the public
will be admitted without having to pay a
shilling to witness the pictures. A catalogue, in fact, could be drawn up,
and might run as follows:—</p>

<h3 class='c007'>A LONDON INTERIOR.</h3>

<p class='c008'>If you have ever been to the Casino, you must have seen young Watts
O'Clock. He aspired, in his Gentish soul, to be "a Fast Man;" and certainly
his ambition was gratified, for he was universally looked upon as the "Fastest
of the Fast." He went so fast that eventually he disappeared altogether.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was going home very late, one dark morning, when I heard my name called
out. I looked up, and noticed before my door an immense advertising van.
The name issued again from one of the little windows at the side, and, lo! I
recognised the Roman nose of Watts O'Clock peeping through it. Where
there is a nose, I said, there must be a face; and if there is a face, it is highly
probable that there is a body somewhere to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Come up, my boy," the same voice and nose continued. I needed no
further invitation. In another minute I was inside the van. True enough,
it was young Watts. The interior was fitted up not very stylishly, but just
as good as any lodging-house. The walls were papered with a handsome pattern,
at three-halfpence a yard. In one corner of the room was a turn-up
bedstead, and in the other a large sofa. A table and two chairs completed
the furniture—with a meerschaum and a lucifer-box.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Glad to see you," he said; "make yourself at home."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It's a queer place for home," I could not help saying.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Not at all. I've been here ten days, and I can assure you it's precious
comfortable. No taxes; and rent only three shillings a week; and nothing
for attendance. Not an extra, except occasionally a turnpike."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And it has one advantage, you can go wherever you like, and move as
often as you please."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Exactly. Last night I slept in Drury Lane; the night before in the
Borough; to-night, you see, I honour your neighbourhood with a visit; this
morning I make a call in Tottenham Court Road, and then on to Gretna
Green."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Gretna Green!" I exclaimed; "whatever is taking you in an advertising
van to Gretna Green?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"A matter of affection," he said, seriously. "Jack, did you ever see an
elopement in high life? Well, then, my good fellow, you shall see one this
morning. Here, I say, old slowcoach," he exclaimed, putting his head out
of the door, and speaking to the driver. "The old shop, Great Russell Street;
and take care of the corners, mind. The stupid fool nearly upset the van
the other day, driving sharp round Percy Street. I was breakfasting at the
time, and received the teapot in my bosom, besides stamping a medal with the
exact copy of my features on a pound of butter."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>"But how came you here?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why, the constable drove me to it. We had a running match together
last week. The long-legged runner of the law was gaining rapidly upon me.
I saw Whitecross before me. Fear lent me the rapidity of a mad bull. Every
one got out of my way. I bounded through the Little Turnstile like a pea
through a tube. I found myself in Holborn. I felt the asthma of the bailiff
close behind me. My left shoulder ached with the ague of a thousand writs.
There is a touch in human nature which makes all mankind run; and that
is the touch of a sheriff's officer. I ran across the road, but lo! an immense
tower, a moving house, a mountain on wheels, in short, an advertising van,
obstructed my path. Hope whispered into my ear, 'Get into it, you donkey!'
In another minute I had jumped over the driver's head, and was inside these
hospitable walls. I peeped through one of the eyes of 'Grimstone's Snuff'
posters, and saw my pursuer looking wildly for me in every direction, wondering
where I had disappeared to. I bought that good driver's silence, and
I have remained his tenant ever since. We go on remarkably well together,
excepting when he takes a strange turn, and upsets me by his clumsy driving.
I stop here, because it is not safe to venture out, and so I have furnished my
portable apartment as comfortably as I can." Here the van stopped, and
Watts said, "Now, my good fellow, I must trouble you to leave me. This is
the house where my flame lives. You see it is burning now in the bedroom
window. She elopes with me to-night. I have been courting her now, thanks
to that long ladder, for the last week. A modern version of Romeo and
Juliet. She has consented to entrust her fortune to me. She is an heiress,
as I needn't tell you. But her window opens. Dear creature, how anxiously
she's expecting me. Fondest Emily, I fly to you. Leave me, Jackey, and
witness this elopement in high life outside my humble habitation." So
saying, he ran up the ladder which was perched against the side of the interior
of his lodging. I watched him from the street. The top of the monster cart
was just on a level with the bedroom windows. A fair form issued out of one.
A pair of arms caught the trembling figure, and they disappeared together
down the hollow square of the van. The next moment a handkerchief, with a
portrait of the winner of the Derby, was waved out of one of the little windows
of the vehicle, and I heard Watts's voice call out, "Coachman, Gretna Green!"
Whether the van ever reached its destination is a mystery which must remain
in darkness for the present.</p>

<p>THE TERMINUS OF THE SOUTH-WESTERN RAILWAY</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 class='c007'>A RAILWAY TRIP IN THE AUTUMN OF 1848 IN<br /> SEARCH OF THE PICTURESQUE.</h3>

<p class='c008'>It is not so easy to find the New Waterloo Terminus of the
South-Western Railway, but, by dint of innumerable halfpence to
innumerable little boys, and chartering several policemen, we
found it at last. It is a good day's walk <em>from</em> Waterloo Bridge—that
is to say, if you cross the river
in the morning, you may reach it
before the evening; even then you
will require to have a guide, or
else you will infallibly pass it
without ever suspecting that tremendous
high wall, with a lamp-post
growing out of the top, is</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/i_368b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_368c.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The architecture of the terminus partakes very largely of the
impromptu Band-box Order. The offices must have been designed
by the architect who ran up in
one day the House of Commons
Committee Rooms. You imagine
innumerable floors must have
been torn up, for all the works
published at this office are bound
in strong boards. However,
they look very light and airy,
though hardly adapted, we
should say, to stand against a
strong wind. It would be a
curious sight to see, some day
next March, a covey of railway
offices winging their way down
the Strand in the direction of
Birdcage Walk.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the railway is whistling
to us. Suppose we take a four-penny
trip down the line to view
the</p>

<h4 class='c017'>SPLENDID SCENERY FROM WATERLOO<br /> BRIDGE TO NINE-ELMS.</h4>

<p class='c008'>We believe there is nothing
like it in the world, excepting
the Blackwall line.</p>

<p class='c000'>We will jot down right and
left the principal beauties that
most enchant us on this picturesque
little railway, which is
certainly the most laconic line
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>that was ever sent through the electric post by one company to
another.</p>

<p class='c000'>We are sitting with our backs (though, by-the-bye, we have but
one back) to the New Cut; the fertile district of Lambeth is on
one side, the milky river on the other.</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/i_369a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_369b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>We were quite taken aback with the immense forest of
chimneys which the engine cuts
through like so much brush
wood; they seem to be the only
vegetation of the place. It is
easy to distinguish the chimneys
that have been recently stacked
from those of previous years'
crops. A curious windmill, supposed
to have attained the age
of three hundred and twenty,
meets the left eye. It is quite
the Methuselah of windmills.
Cockney artists come from far
and near to ask it to give them
a sitting.</p>

<p class='c000'>Your right eye will not fail to
light up with the group of merry
pipers that are sitting on the
roof of the "Duke of Wellington."
Their bright tankards
sparkle in the sun, with which
they moisten their respective
clays. They present a pleasing
picture of the happy peasantry
of the suburbs. One laughing
fellow presents his tankard to
us, but we are obliged to refuse
it, from the reason that the railway
will not stop to allow us to
take it.</p>

<p class='c000'>An immense volume of smoke
from a supposed brewery, though
the perfume from the brewery is
not particularly hoppy, is at the
present moment delivered to the
public in numbers. The passenger,
if he is wise, will shut his
eyes, and not open them again till he sees that it has quite
blown over.</p>

<p class='c000'>A magpie in a wicker cage, suspended from an attic window,
is worth the passing sympathy of the third-class passenger. The
first-class ditto can have no sympathy, from the obvious fact that
he cannot see anything (<span class='sc'>Mem.</span> To enjoy nature, there is nothing
like the third-class; to enjoy a good snooze, there is nothing like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>the first.) We do not envy that poor magpie, with the engine
rushing by him all day long. See how he crouches into the corner
of his prison! And hark! he has learnt the railway whistle.
Wretched bird! thou canst not have a pleasant life of it. How
willingly, methinks, thou wouldst hop the twig, if thou couldst!</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/i_370a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_370b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>But what is that? It looks like a large game of scratch-cradle—but
no, it isn't—it is
merely the top of a gas factory.
We wonder if they take off the
lids of those immense black
cauldrons, when they want to
see how the pot boils?</p>

<p class='c000'>Behold how contentedly that
man is smoking his pipe, with
his bare arms resting on the parapet
of the railway, as if it were
a cushion. The train rushes
screaming by him, but not an
eye winks, not a nerve shakes.
The pipe still hangs from the
lips of that iron man—well
adapted to live so close and be,
a railway sleeper. By-the-bye,
it cannot be pleasant to have
an engine almost touching your
bedroom window whilst you are
shaving!</p>

<p class='c000'>Look to your right, you will
see the Houses of Parliament,
the Barrycade of Westminster
that has now been up for six
years, and likely to remain up
for thirty more. The bird you
see on the top is a crane. It
is sacred hereabouts, and is highway
robbery if any one attempts
to dislodge it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Thames is worth looking
at; but you must be quick, for
unless you look down that narrow
street before the train passes
it, you will not see it. The silver
speck—like a half-crown—you
see at the end of that lane is the Thames.</p>

<p class='c000'>Turn quick to the left; you will perceive what an Englishman
most delights in—a fight.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bah! you're too late; the Policeman has emerged from some
invisible spot, and the fight is adjourned. One man in blue disperses
five hundred Britons.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>You will see plenty of English Interiors on each side of the
country. They display all varieties of paper, mostly at a halfpenny
a yard. How desolate the fireplaces look, and yet they are
interesting, as the last abiding-places of the grate must always
be.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>How ferocious those chimneys look!—they give you quite a
turn. Hurrah! now we approach
Vauxhall! At night you
can see the fireworks for nothing.
Sometimes they drop in also
upon you. A Roman wheel occasionally
visits the first-class
carriage, when he proves a very
troublesome visitor, and which
no one likes to turn out. The
sticks—the departed ghosts of
the short-lived rockets—think
nothing of falling down upon the
third-class passengers. But in
the day-time you have nothing
of these entertainments. All
you see is the shell of the
pagoda peeping through the
trees, or an artist busy in
veneering ham for the sandwiches; or you may get a small
view of the airy abode of Il Diavolo, who led such a wire-drawn
existence.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_371d.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Holla! there's a cab coming over Vauxhall Bridge, and a
steamer going underneath it. The horse still carries it over steam
occasionally.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_372b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Now, you have reached the Vauxhall terminus. But which
is the way out? There, down
that trap. Why, it looks like the
cabin of a steamer; but it isn't.
Venture down it—it only takes
you into the cellar, for the passengers
at this station are shot
out through a dry arch. But
this species of exit—underhand
as it is—is not half so perplexing
as the one at Waterloo Bridge—as
they will persist in calling
the terminus—though never
were Directors so far out in their calculations. Here, as you rush
in a hurry to discover the exit, you are stopped by the following
directions:—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_372d.jpg' alt='THE WAY OUT' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Well, how have you enjoyed your trip? Only consider the
variegated landscape, the picturesque scenery, the wonderful insight
into the domestic habits of the natives, which you have just enjoyed
in your delightful little trip of three minutes' rapid flight
over roof and chimneys, from Waterloo Bridge to Nine Elms.
If you are a real lover of nature, you will never forget it as long
as you live.</p>

all, she had been terribly upset by the shaking of the steam-vessel, for she
tumbled out of her berth, and it was a thousand mercies she was not smashed
into a thousand pieces. As it was, the shock was too much for her delicate
nerves, and she was laid up for a month in a drawer. Her beautiful ringlets
(auburn, you will recollect) all fell off. Her lovely complexion had completely
gone from dropping into the sea, and her pretty eyelids, once so quick, would
neither open nor shut, though I tried pins and everything I could think of to
make her open them. Oh, Araminta darling, believe me when I assure you
I was tossed about so madly that I was completely bouleversé.</p>

<p class='c021'>"I was quite distracted with the fearful change. I called in the assistance
of the most experienced Italian doll-makers, but their remedies were unavailing.
My little pet gradually got worse, when mamma's French maid, Smith, persuaded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>me to apply to my sister's toilet-table for restoratives. After several
applications of Macassar Oil to her bald head, I cannot tell you how delighted
I was to perceive the hair beginning to grow again. I jumped for joy. I
was quite a little mad thing for the space of ten minutes! But I persevered,
and now (thanks be to that sweet Rowland) her ringlets are just as beautiful
as ever, with this slight difference, that they are now jet black instead of the
light auburn they formerly were. The little dear looks all the better for the
change of hair. Still its complexion was <em>so</em> very bad, I did not like to take
her out with me into society at all. Smith again, like a good creature,
recommended me to try some of Rowland's Kalydor. I did. I washed the
darling's face with it every morning for a week, and you
will scarcely believe it, but it is no story, when I assure
you that my doll has quite resumed her pristine bloom,
and is now as pure and as lovely as ever. But her eyes
pained me the most, so I made bold to ask Sir John
Sheepshanks, who never travels without Holloway's Ointment,
to oblige me with a little bit. He gave me as
much as would cover your tongue, and, before putting her
to bed, I placed it over her eyelids, and the next morning
gave her a good pinch of Grimstone's Eye Snuff, when,
upon pulling the strings, will you credit me on my word,
my dearest Araminta, when I inform you that her eyelids
opened and shut just as well as when my dear papa gave
me the beautiful doll on my birthday. I was going to give
her a small box (price 11<em>s.</em>) of Parr's Life Pills, but Smith
assured me she would probably come <em>alive</em>, and I was
frightened, as we have no nurserymaid here to attend to
her. My doll is now quite a new creature, and I should
advise you, Minta dearest, to try the same remedies, if ever you find yours
looking faint, or losing her colour, or growing old.</p>

Voice Lozenges, and now she says 'Pa' and 'Ma' more distinctly than ever.
You recollect, too, her voice was a deep baritone. It has changed to the most
beautiful falsetto! Isn't it wonderful?"</p>

<h3 class='c007'>HOW STARS ARE DISCOVERED.</h3>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Mons. Arago</span> says:—"Talking of the new fashion of discovering stars:—there's
my friend Millevoye, who wrote to me post-haste one morning to say,
he had just discovered two new stars! Now, one star is enough at any time,
but two were so surprising in my eyes, that I rushed to him immediately to
see if there was anything in them. 'Come, my dear Millevoye,' I said, 'can
you look me in the face and say you have discovered two new stars?' 'I
can,' he said boldly, and he turned his eyes full upon mine. The absurdity
of the thing flashed so ridiculously upon me that I could not help laughing—the
double discovery was at once apparent—<em>for the poor fellow squinted</em>. Take
my word, never believe in a new star till you have seen it yourself."</p>

<h3 class='c007'>ASTLEY'S HISTORICAL QUESTIONS.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Many of us owe to a visit to Astley's our earliest initiation into
the mysteries of histories; and we
are of opinion that a set of questions
should be framed in accordance
with these grand dog-mata—or
horse-mata, as a maliciously-disposed
person might call them—which
we have gleaned from the
boards of that great equestrian
establishment. The arena of the
circus is not a mere desert of sand
or sawdust to him who looks at
it with an intelligent eye, for many
a wise saw may be picked up from
the aforesaid sawdust, if the eye
itself does not disdain the humility
of the pupil. We subjoin a few
specimens of the sort of questions
and answers that would be found
to meet the case, if we looked at
history through some of Astley's
grand spectacles.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Q.</em> How was the battle of Waterloo
decided?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>A.</em> By six Scotch Greys popping
out from under two trusses of straw
beautifully divided into six, and
representing about half a pint of "standing corn," from which the
gallant fellows emerged in time to "discomfit" eight French
cuirassiers, who retired before the battery of the flats of the
enemy's swords upon their highly polished breast-plates.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Q.</em> How did Napoleon succeed in crossing the Alps?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>A.</em> He was carried across in an open boat on the backs of four
supernumeraries.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Q.</em> In what manner did the Emperor travel to Russia?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>A.</em> In a pasteboard hackney-coach, gorgeously emblazoned with
Dutch metal, and which had been discovered among the rich relics
of barbarism used for the old melodrama of Xaia of China.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Q.</em> How did the Duke of Wellington behave at Waterloo?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>A.</em> He never spoke a single word, but pranced about, looking unutterable
things, on a piebald charger.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Q.</em> To what are our successes in India attributable?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>A.</em> To Lady Sale having surmounted an extensive range of platforms
on a highly trained steed, and called upon "the whole strength
of the company, with a numerous train of auxiliaries," to "advance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>for the honour of Old England," while the band in the orchestra
played "Rule Britannia."</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Q.</em> Mention some prominent points connected with the burning
of Moscow?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>A.</em> There were several terrific bangs, which had the effect of
throwing a red glare over the whole scene; and several of the public
buildings fell like the flap of a dining-table, showing underneath a
very ruinous state of things; while the inhabitants appeared to be
indulging themselves in letting off squibs and crackers into the air
for the purpose of heightening the horrors of the conflagration.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Q.</em> What became of Napoleon's trusty Mameluke?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>A.</em> On the last occasion that he took a part in public affairs he
was recognised as a baker who had been just pillaged and pummelled
by the clown in a pantomime.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Q.</em> State some of the most striking peculiarities of the late Emperor
Napoleon?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>A.</em> He chiefly depended for his advice on the "ferry-man" of his
army; he took immense quantities of "property" snuff from a
"practicable" snuff-box; he granted long interviews to "females in
distress," and finished every alternate speech he made by declaring
himself "the son of destin<em>ie</em>."</p>

<h3 class='c007'>APOLLO ARRESTED BY A WRIT.</h3>

<p class='c008'>It was said of a certain officer of a certain sheriff, "nihil tetigit
quod non ornavit," which means that it was really an honour to
receive a tap on the shoulder at his hands, and we have no doubt
that even a writ would have acquired from his peculiar touch a grace
and a dignity. We know there is nothing that may not be elevated
by poetry, and we have endeavoured therefore to force the Muses
into the service of a writ for the purpose of investing it with a new
charm, and giving it what it ought to possess—a taking character,
in place of the old prosaic form, which is repulsive rather than attractive,
and instead of enabling every one who runs to read, causes every
one who reads to run. We would throw it into verse, and, by giving
it poetical feet, place it on quite a new footing:—</p>

a few that will go to the bosom of every gentleman, especially
those who have carried them—as the pressure of so many articles
must have been rather inconvenient, if carried in the waistcoat

<h3 class='c007'>THE GAME OF FRIGHT.</h3>

<p class='c008'>This round game has been played very extensively in France and
other countries this year. In some circles the king has been thrown
out and all the honours put aside, which has increased the fright to
a very great extent, as it was always doubtful what low card would
be the next turn up. Hitherto the clubs have been uppermost, and
the knaves have shared all the spoil; but people are just beginning
to see through the game, and are calling for a fresh pack; so we
hope there will soon be an end to fright.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>A POCKET-BOOK PICKED UP IN THE GREAT<br /> DESERT.<br /> (SUPPOSED TO HAVE BELONGED TO A FASHIONABLE TOURIST.)</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The Great Desert is only solitary confinement applied to travelling.</p>

<p class='c000'>If you wish to know yourself, travel by yourself; and, egad! you
will never wish to renew the intimacy.</p>

<p class='c000'>I can't make out the Sphinx; but I suppose it must have been
the first likeness taken in stone. If the Egyptians could not make
better riddles than that, they were perfectly right in never trying
their hands upon another.</p>

<p class='c000'>They say this place is very romantic; but, on my word, I cannot
see it, and I have looked everywhere. If there be a romance, it can
only be a flying volume of Sand. I recollect my eyes filling several
times, and certainly I cried once till I was nearly blinded; but on
the whole I prefer the Waverly Novels.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the Pyramids had been in Paris, they would have been broken
long ago for barricades.</p>

<p class='c000'>We are strange creatures; we leave London because it is empty,
and come to the Great Desert for a change; for myself, I like London
best; there may not be a soul, but you can get a sherry-cobbler,
and there is the waiter at all events to speak to.</p>

<p class='c000'>What is Society? Running away from one's self; but here you
only run to meet yourself. You might as well turn hermit, or toll-man
on Southwark Bridge.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have met with but one sign of civilization since I have been
here, and that was an empty soda-water bottle off Cairo!</p>

<p class='c000'>I cannot see the fun of climbing up that Great Pyramid. It is
immense labour, and, like an election, is attended with bribery and
corruption at every step, for you have to pay those greedy Moors
before they will give you a hand, or the smallest lift.</p>

<p class='c000'>I could not help shouting out, as I saw a big fat alderman-looking
fellow going up, "Twopence, Moor, and up goes the donkey!" It
was very vulgar, but I could not help it.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is time that those forty centuries were relieved. I know of but
one man to do it, and that's Widdicombe.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am certain solitude begets contempt. If I were to stop here
another day I should positively hate myself.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had the bump of travelling, but have quite lost it now, after
travelling for a week on a camel.</p>

<p class='c000'>Stupid people express their astonishment at the quantity of stones
collected by the Egyptians to build the Pyramids, and never bestow
the smallest wonder at the immense collection of dust; and yet the
one is just as wonderful as the other, and, I am sure, much more
difficult to get over.</p>

<p class='c000'>Decidedly travelling in the plains of Egypt will never be comfortable
till they introduce watering-carts.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>If you wish to ascertain how slowly the sand of human life trickles
through the minute glass, go to the Great Desert. But I suppose
"what must be, must;" in other words, as the Duke of Bedford
would say, "Che Sahara, Sahara." But the proverb is rather
musty.</p>

<p class='c000'>I wonder they do not lay down a railway here. No elevations
required, no tunnels excepting through the Needles, and Obelisks,
and Tombs; everything is as smooth as a billiard-table; it looks as
if it had been laid down on purpose, ready ruled for a series of lines.
One thing, however, is very plain, and that is, they do not catch me
in the Great Desert again until there is a railway!</p>

<h3 class='c007'>WHAT DO ALL ENGLISHMEN TAKE OFF THEIR<br /> HATS TO?<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c022'><sup>[8]</sup></a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Who is it that gets the most salutes in England?
We do not mean the powder which is
thundered into the Queen's ears wherever she
goes, but the quiet salute which a person makes
by taking his hat off.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, every Englishman dislikes taking his hat
off. It is a trouble, and no genuine John Bull
likes more trouble than he can help. It must be
something, then, of very great importance—of
general love and feeling—a chord that strikes all
Englishmen's hearts—that makes everybody,
without a single exception, take his hat off to it?</p>

<p class='c000'>What can it be?</p>

<p class='c000'>Is it Prince Albert? No; for, familiar as the prints of His
Royal Highness may have made his handsome face in the eyes of
those who look into print shops, still, from love of retirement, he is
not generally known by the public, and he could easily pass down
Lowther Arcade without fear of being recognised.</p>

<p class='c000'>Who is it, then?</p>

<p class='c000'>Is it the Duke of Wellington? No. It is true he commands a
number of upraised hats. All those who know his venerable nose,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>and know how much England is indebted to it, pay him that little
mark of respect. But, popular as the Duke is, every one is not
acquainted with him, and there are even a few who still nourish
a dislike of his political opinions, forgetting the best part, and only
recollecting the worst part, of the man.</p>

<p>A GOOD PARTY CRY.</p>

<p class='c000'>Can it be a creditor?</p>

<p class='c000'>Certainly not; for debtors always make a practice of avoiding
their creditors, especially those of a large amount, or one of the
Hebrew persuasion. There may be a few who get a stray lift of
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chapeau</span></i>, by way of reconciliation, but in general the eyes of
him that owes rarely meet the eyes of him to whom money is owing.
We are all blind to our own interest, especially when we pay 10 per
cent. for it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps it is the wind?</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, this is a vile quibble; for the reader knows well enough
that no man takes off his hat to the wind. On the contrary, the
whole energy of a man's ten fingers is concentrated on the rebellious
rim, with the view of holding the fugitive castor on. The
wind takes off many hats; it is repeatedly done on Waterloo Bridge,
and round the corner of St. Paul's Churchyard—you will see it
any day during March; but it is preposterous to say that a single
hat is ever taken off to the wind.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, then, what is it?</p>

<p class='c000'>Patience for ten lines, and you shall know. Growl, amiable
reader, but read.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is, you must know, a curious instrument, or rather a collection
of instruments, that go at once to the bosoms of all Englishmen.
It subdues discord, and substitutes pleasant harmony for it. No
sooner is a note of it heard than off flies every hat, the whole
assembly rises; fifty thousand bare heads—if there are so many
present—instantly respect the majesty of the appeal, and fifty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>thousand voices—if you can only count them—join in glad response
to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>But what is it?</p>

<p class='c000'>Foreigners even respect it, and take off their hats.</p>

<p class='c000'>Once more—What is it?</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, that which has most hats taken off to it, is—</p>

<p class='c000'>Stop! I have it (cries a young musician, who had the signal
honour of beating the big drum in the Drury Lane orchestra on the
stormy nights of <em>Monte Christo</em>): It's—</p>

<p class='c000'>Be quiet, sir. It's no such thing. Learn, young man, that
you've no right to rob any one of his secret. Sit down, sir, and
allow us to say—</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, then, say it, and be—</p>

<p class='c000'>And this proves that we English are the most loyal people in the

<p class='c000'>But who can tell whether the reason why the tremendous shower
of revolutions, which have fallen this year as thick as hail all over
the Continent, have done such little injury in England, is simply
because our beloved country is deeply insured in every office, farm,
mansion, cottage, in every English heart, by the loyal policy of

<h3 class='c007'>SQUIBS IN STATUES.</h3>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>The</span> newspapers make no mention of a
statue that was forwarded to the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Beaux Arts</span></i> at the late competition,
for the best design upon the
Republique. It was a likeness
of the Siamese Twins,
who are supposed to have
sent their adhesion to the
French Government. It was
meant to typify <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fraternité</span></i>
and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Egalité</span></i>, but was objected
to as being too figurative.
The artist altered the attitudes
and sent it again; saying
he had made the statue literal
enough this time, and that
his correction enabled him fortunately
to include <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Liberté</span></i>, in
addition to the other two types
of the Red Republicans. Upon
being exhibited, it was found
that he had made the Twins
fighting in the most fraternal
fashion. The result of the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Liberté</span></i> was, that the artist was immediately carried off to prison, for
such designs upon the Republique could not be possibly winked at.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>VALUABLE ADVICE.</h3>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>To Persons about to Marry.</span>—Don't buy your furniture at
Felix Summerley's Cheap Art-Manufacture Mart.</p>

<p class='c000'>The above advice is given to young couples about to plunge into
the deep waters of matrimony—that awful plunge which is to determine
whether their future happiness is to go on swimmingly, or
to sink for ever like the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Télémaque</span></i>, with all its fabulous treasures on
board, when nothing is saved from the wreck excepting a few <em>spars</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>That long voyage, however, which ends only with the loss of one
of the mates, is generally never undertaken but with the strictest
economy. The speculation may turn out a bad one; things may
be thrown overboard from distress that swallowed up, before sailing,
a little ocean of money, but they are usually selected with care, and
nothing is shipped but what will fetch in the end almost as much as
it cost at first. A mother—that most thrifty shipper in the harbour
of life—generally lays in the cargo, and every article is weighed to
a scruple in the scales of her judgment, before it is sent home to
make the anxious passage to the United States.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>We can imagine a fond but imprudent couple going to Felix
Summerley's beautiful Emporium of Art-Manufactures. They have
no more money than they can spare, but the husband has an eye
for the beautiful, and the wife likes—and where is the woman that
doesn't?—to have everything of the best. They are tossed about
on the beautiful carpets and lovely counterpanes, quite dazzled with
the glittering warming-pans, inflamed with the glowing coal-scuttles
of every possible age and period, whilst each bright poker they
touch burns them to buy it. They go on hopping from one easy
chair to another, now dwelling on a carved Artevelde sofa, now conversing
with a Gothic dumb-waiter, dumbfounded the next minute

put upon them, we must confess there is some truth in it. Our
officers were never clever at cutting, and this may account for their
making such bad tailors. It is a thousand pities that the Laurel
which clusters round the brows of our Commanders, should be
entwined with so much cabbage. It is true the geese saved the
Capitol of Rome, but we do not think the Horse Guards need put
itself under the wings of the British goose. If it does, Moses, in a
very short time, will be cutting out Prince Albert as a Field
Marshal. Never was the British army so surprised before, as when
that cruel shell-jacket attempted by sheer treachery to cut off the
rear from the main body of the forces. The French have a saying
"<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Le Riaicule tue</span></i>," so our soldiers may be diminished, in a ridiculous
manner little expected by our political economists, if this new
deadly weapon is discharged at them; for there is many a brave
fellow who can stand fire, who falls dead before ridicule. The
Horse Guards must not be a clothes mart, or a masquerade warehouse,
or else the Duke, when he puts himself at the head of the
army, will revive the old title of the Duc de Guys, and the national
cry will be, "Sauve qui peut."</p>

<p class='c008'>If your health is proposed, you must say it is the proudest
moment of your life.</p>

<p class='c000'>You are not expected to take your hat in with you to dinner. It
is liable to be kicked about if you put it under the table—people
mistake it for the cat.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is no longer the fashion to say, "Here's to you, miss," and
"I drink to you, ma'am," to every lady round the table before you
take a glass of wine; however, if you do it once, never repeat it.</p>

<p class='c000'>When you begin a speech, you must be sure to state you are
unaccustomed to public speaking.</p>

<p class='c000'>Take your coat off in the hall, but never give up your umbrella.
If the servant offers to take it down stairs to dry it, tell him to mind
his own business; and if he says another word, threaten to report
him to his missus, and he will soon be quiet. The robberies of umbrellas
in London is something awful!</p>

<p>A University Chair of Music.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>If you go to the opera don't call out for "Music!" or tell
"Nosey," or any of the "catgut scrapers,"
to strike up. Be careful also not to insult
the box-keeper, by giving him a penny to
run and fetch a playbill. If you take a lady,
dispense with the usual gallantry of a bag
of oranges. Should you take any, however,
it is usual to offer them to all the ladies
round you—after you have peeled them.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is no longer the fashion for a stranger
to call at Buckingham Palace; but if there
should be a Drawing Room, you had better
go, by all means, and present your homage
to your Sovereign, for otherwise it might
look disrespectful. You have only to go in
costume, with the sword and cocked hat, and send in your card,
"with your compliments."</p>

<p class='c000'>If you are invited out to dinner, you must refrain as much as you
can from taking a snooze directly the cloth is removed; and you
should be above drinking the warm water that is given you, in a
blue bowl, for your fingers.</p>

<p class='c000'>If you intend to dance, do not, as a matter of pride, fill your
pockets with halfpence; and if you have a new pair of Berlins, put
them on, and do not keep them folded up in your hands, as if you
were too shabby to use them.</p>

<p class='c000'>If Joseph Ady sends you an invitation, write back word that
you will come and take tea with him. You will find him a good
sovereign fellow, and you may probably hear of something to your
advantage.</p>

<p>Shakspeare, after Curling.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Have your hair curled; but if you take
a lady down to the refreshment-room,
you must know her extremely well before
you can presume to ask her if "she'll
have a drop of beer," or else she will certainly
be offended.</p>

<p class='c000'>When you are leaving, supposing the
servant at the door puts his hand out,
shake it by all means, or else the poor
fellow will fancy you are proud.</p>

<p class='c000'>You are not bound to answer any public
questions in the street, as to "Who
are you?" or to put any stranger in possession
of personal facts relating to
"your mother."</p>

<p class='c000'>If you are in doubt about a cab fare, or want to know some particular
fact about the twopenny omnibuses, or the age of an actress,
or a point at cribbage, or where the best glass of ale is to be had—write
to the Duke of Wellington, and you will have an answer from
the F. M. the same day.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>You are not bound to go to every theatre, or to see every exhibition
in London. In fact, please yourself, and do not stop in town
a day longer than you choose; for you will find the "boots" generally
very reluctant to call you the morning you intend to start.
For better precaution, you had better shave over night, and tie a
piece of string to your big toe for the policeman to pull the first
thing in the morning.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE DOMESTIC MANNERS AND<br /> CUSTOMS OF THE BEDOUIN<br /> ARABS.<br /> BY ONE WHO HAS NEVER BEEN AMONGST<br /> THEM, BUT CAN IMAGINE EXACTLY WHAT<br /> THEY ARE.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Those Bedouins are curious fellows.
You have heard of a race of Jumpers;
well, they are a nation of Leapers.
We walk, they fly. They are the bats
of the human race—not men, and decidedly
not angels, but something between
the two.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their houses have no windows lower
than the third floor. This is to prevent
little boys jumping up. Their
windows are not arranged like ours,
but have small apertures, like the
slits in letter-boxes, slanting downwards,
to prevent any one looking into
them. Bricks are exceedingly dear, on
account of the height of the walls.</p>

<p class='c000'>A military review of Bedouin Arabs
exceeds anything of the sort. At a
given signal a whole battalion springs
upwards, gets inextricably mingled in
one dense flying column, and then falls
down again, each man precisely in his
previous position. They discharge
their muskets when they reach a given
height, and no accident ever occurs,
unless a raw recruit happens to have
sprained his ankle. Some of their light
columns advance twelve feet deep;
when I say twelve feet deep, of course
I mean in the air.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>It is curious to see them in the
streets. If the door is not open, they will take a flying leap through
the window, like a harlequin. The first sign of intelligence a Bedouin
child gives, is to leap straight out of its cradle. A lid is always
placed over it, for the purpose of keeping it down; and when the
lid is taken off the child flies out, like a living Jack-in-the-Box.</p>

<p class='c000'>A steeplechase is with them literally a steeplechase. They have
no horses, but clear churches, pillars, obelisks, everything that
comes in their way, on foot.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their animals have, in a smaller degree, the same agile propensities.
When two cats dart up into the air, fighting, they are soon
lost in the clouds, and you will hear them mollrowing above you
for a long time; but I defy you to say, you ever saw <em>both</em> of them
come back.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Bedouins go out shooting they pursue the game in the
air, and do not fire until they are right over the bird's back. It is
a mean sport, however, which a real Bedouin gentleman is above
doing. But their children catch sparrows easily, by putting salt
upon their tails.</p>

<p class='c000'>A Bedouin Arab does not give his hand in marriage, but his foot.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sheik blesses his people once a year. He springs from his
balcony, and when he has reached the centre of the populace, he
gives his blessing, so that he may fall equally on the heads of all
his subjects; and then he springs back to his balcony, and the
ceremony is concluded. One poor Sheik (Ben Allah Wishi Washi)
had the gout, and could not do this. He tried to bless them in a
balloon once, but the enraged populace would not have it, and tore
it to pieces, amid loud cries of "Shame!" He was sentenced to wear
tight boots for life—the most ignominious punishment that can be
put upon one of Bedouin extraction.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their postmen are let off from the post-office like pigeons—they
drop the letters down the chimneys.</p>

<p>A BEDOUIN VESTRY MEETING.<br /><br />Chairman—"Sons of Allah, the meeting is now up."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A meeting is adjourned very primitively. The chairman lifts his
leg, and the whole meeting suddenly takes to its heels and springs
into the air, like so many thousand frogs, and the next minute there
is not one left.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>Their dances are very lively. They generally take place in the
open air, or else if they danced in a room, they would be knocking
their heads every minute against the ceiling. To see them all take
the same leap simultaneously, and <em>balancezing</em> some fifty feet above
the earth, is something so extraordinary, that it almost lifts you off
your feet. No less extraordinary are their ballets. They are more
like fire-works than any other exhibition; and you hear the loud exclamations
of "O—o—h" escape from the crowd, when a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">première
danseuse</span></i> takes a higher flight than usual. Their <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grand pas</span></i> are
always watched through long telescopes, which are let out at the
doors for six piastres a night.</p>

<p class='c000'>A Bedouin duel will sometimes last for days, for it is always the
object of the person who is to be shot to get out of the fire of his
adversary, and thus they will go on jumping after one another over
the whole kingdom for a week together.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nurses toss their babies up in the air, and if they are slow in
coming down, they jump up after them and fetch them.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have heard of a game of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">écarté</span></i> being played, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à vol d'aigle</span></i>, some
15,000 feet above the level of the sea. The great dodge is to prevent
your partner jumping up behind you to look over your cards.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bedouin Royalty does not wear a crown, but a pair of spring-heeled
jack-boots, and it is high treason for any one but the Sheik
to put his foot into it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Bedouin Arabs are a cheerful people—their active life leads
them to be hilarious. They are early risers, and are generally up
with the lark. They are a volatile, but happy race; and it is very
rarely you hear of a Bedouin Arab having corns. He will take up
a bill, too, quicker than any man.</p>

<div  class='figleft id008'>
<img src='images/i_411di.jpg' alt='Oh' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c008'>MY dear sir, if ever there was a
miserable woman in this world, it
is the poor creature who now
takes up her pen to tell you how
wretched she is. I have not slept
a wink all night. I must tell you
my husband is <em>dreadfully suspicious</em>,
and so am I—and the
best of women at times; but still
I never could have suspected he
would have suspected me in the
abominable suspicious manner he
has lately done. Will you believe
it, sir, he declared last night that
he could plainly see I wanted to
"<em>pisen him</em>." The fact is, we had
for supper some mushrooms and a
lovely pie just warmed up with a
little steak in it, for I thought I would give him a treat—and nicer
mushrooms, or a tenderer steak, I think I never tasted in all my
life—when what does my fine gentleman do but turn up his fine
nose! Only first I must tell you that he ate a very 'arty supper,
and had his whisky toddy all nice and comfortable—for I must
have mixed him six glasses if I mixed him one—and
smoked his pipe, though I have told him over
and over again I would not allow any such filthy
practices in my house, especially the parlour. But
kindness is thrown away upon some men; for what
does my Mr. Smellfungus do, but he turns round upon
me, and because he feels a big pain in his side, accuses
me on the spot of wishing to "<em>pisen him</em>."
Those were his very words. Oh! that I should have
lived to have heard them; but it is not the first time
by ever so many that the suspicious creature has
dared to turn round upon me in this bumptious
manner. The first time he degraded himself in my
eyes with these low suspicions was when he had been
eating pies at Twickenham, and we were returning
home in the steamer, when all of a sudden he called
the whole cabin to witness that he was sure "<em>I had
pisened him</em>." Oh, dear! I was so struck that I
No, that I didn't; but I told him, once for all,
if ever he dared to bring such a heavy charge against me I would
make him pay for it dearly, that I would, even if it cost me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>my life. Here the <em>monster</em> laughed, and dropt the poison, but he
brought it up again soon afterwards; for I recollect it was on a Friday,
and we had a most lovely giblet pie for dinner, though not a morsel
as big as a pin's head could I touch, for I was busy all the while
picking bones with my wretch of a husband, and I really thought I
should have choked, I was in such a way with him. He had no
sooner emptied the dish than he threw the "<em>pisen</em>" again in my
face; and he did it also another time when we had a quince pie—and
a nice delicious squince, in my eyes, is worth a Jew's eye any
day; but my dainty lord and master could see nothing but <em>pisen</em> at
the bottom of it, and complained of cholera and pins and needles in
his inside, and I don't know what else. So this morning I packed
up my bandbox, and asked him boldly what he had got in his head
lately? and that his low base suspicions had completely poisoned
my existence, and that I would jump into the Thames as <em>sure as I
was born</em> sooner than be suspected any longer. When my brazen
<em>monster</em>, who is known for not</p>

<p>STICKING AT TRIFLES,</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>draws his chair close up to mine, and laughs in my face, which
made me so boil over that, in the heat of the moment, I threw the
teapot at him, and then the slop-basin, and after that the milk-jug.
I did not spare the crockery, or the brute either, for I was not going
to be accused for nothing, I can tell you; but the more cups I
broke, the more saucily he laughed, till the big drops ran down his
fat face, and he asked me, with a nasty grin I didn't half like,
"Whether I thought he belonged to a <em>burial</em> society for nothing?"</p>

<p class='c000'>Oh! sir, the truth flashed all at once across my two eyes, for I
knew my husband had been reading these horrible newspapers
lately, and I felt instinctively they had poisoned his mind, so I ran
out of the house without my bonnet, and—will you believe it?—my
hair still in curl-papers, and got into a cab, vowing I would never
put my foot in it again until he had gone down upon his bended
knees and confessed I was a poor injured wrongly-suspected woman.
I would sooner be a widow at once than be thrown about in such a
way. Oh! sir, I ask you if it is not infamous, after being married
to a man these fifteen years and more, to be suspected of giving
him his gruel with a spoonful of arsenic, and of wishing to hurry
him out of this world on a nasty toadstool instead of a fine mush-room?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>But, sir, it's these infamous papers. I wish they were all
burnt of a heap, for I can plainly trace every bit of my pretty
Smellfungus's suspicions to those atrocious "<span class='sc'>Poisonings in Essex</span>,"
which have lately given the public such a turn. Since they have
been published, every husband suspects that his darling wife wishes
to kill him in order to receive the filthy bonus for burying him. I
cannot tell you how many poor suffering wives are separated at the
present moment from their brutes of husbands because they have
had this abominable poison flung in their teeth every day for the
last two months. The poor <em>innocent injured dears</em> of men dare not
now for their lives take a single meal in their houses, for fear it
should be their last! It's quarrelling with their own bread and
butter, to say the very least of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>I remain, sir, at my hotel (the "Two Magpies"), till my cruel
good-for-nothing lord and master chooses to come and fetch me.</p>

<p class='c000'>P.S.—Oh! sir, my husband has just been here, and tells me it
was only meant as a joke—a pretty joke, indeed!—and that, as
Hamlet says, he was only "<em>pisening</em> in jest," for how could he help
suspecting, when I gave him nothing but pies—beafsteak pies, eel
pies, giblet pies, quince, and mince, and all sorts of pies—but that
I regularly wanted to <em>pisen</em> him! D'ye see—<em>pies</em> and <em>pise</em>ning? I
never heard such a joke! How men can make such donkeys of
themselves I don't know! But I couldn't well be angry with the
silly fellow, for he has brought me <em>such</em> a beautiful shawl; and I
need not tell you, sir, that in matrimony a lovely Cashmere hides a

      <div class='line'>And they haven't a penny;</div>

      <div class='line'>On themselves they'll spend pounds—</div>

      <div class='line'>Storming and raging past all assuaging.</div>

      <div class='line'>After all your fine doings, your strugglings and stewings—why, "the house is in ruins!"</div>
      <div class='line'>Then the wine goes like winking, and they cannot help thinking you've taken to drinking;</div>
      <div class='line'>They're perpetually rows keeping, 'cause out of the house-keeping they're in bonnets their spouse keeping;</div>
      <div class='line'>So when they've been meated, if with pies they're not treated, they vow that they're cheated;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then against Ascot Races, and all such sweet places, they set their old faces;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>And they'll never leave town, nor to Broadstairs go down, though with bile you're quite brown;</div>

      <div class='line'>Then to add to your woes, they say nobody knows how the money all goes, but they pay through the nose for the dear children's clothes;</div>

<p>ARABIAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 class='c007'>"ANY ONE FOR EGYPT?—EGYPT!"</h3>

<p class='c008'>Of course we shall have a Railway to Grand Cairo—the <span class='sc'>London and
Great Desert Direct</span>. How the antiquaries will get over this attack upon
the very seat of their learning it is impossible to say. Will they stand idly
by and not resent this blow levelled at their renowned Sesostris—this slap
given to their Cheops?</p>

<p class='c000'>However, as a matter of course, there will be a continual succession of
cheap trips under the influence of Crisp. Every Englishman, who can afford
to spend a week and a five-pound note in the pursuit of pleasure, will be sure
to go. For in addition to the "<span class='sc'>Magnificent Scenery</span>," "<span class='sc'>Free Admission
to all the Pyramids</span>," &amp;c. &amp;c., the advertisements will doubtless assure
us that in every town at which the train stops, a professor will be engaged,
so that whilst the travellers are swallowing their soup, they may be crammed
with a complete knowledge of the language of the country—a process which
will enable Englishmen to digest Coptic and Oxtail at one and the same time.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Railway will assuredly be the making of Egypt and the Egyptians.
In a very little time the Desert Sara will become as lively as Cremorne, and
its sands as much frequented by the ladies as those of Ramsgate while the
gentlemen are bathing. Villages will spring up in the bosom of the country
almost as rapidly as mustard and cress would in the bosom of an Irishman.
The sources of the Nile will afford beautiful spots for picnics where parties
bringing their own tea may be accommodated with hot water; and the great
Lake of Mæris will of course be thoroughly repaired, and opened as a National
Swimming Bath—warranted free from Crocodiles.</p>

<p><em>Cheap Excursion Trains</em>—</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>Then the Pyramids will be just the very place for some Mustapha Bunn to
begin an operatic season in; the only thing required to be done will be to fit
up each Sarcophagus as a private box; get a monster band with a mammoth
ophicleide to play the Desert, and engage the celebrated vocal statue of
Memnon to sing a solo. What a splendid joke too for the clown to let off on
the first night of the Pantomime; when, after turning his toes in, rolling his
eyes, and thrusting his tongue out, he cries, "Here we are again! Thirty
centuries are a-lookin' down on us! Somebody's a-coming!" This alone
would fill the Pyramids.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then again as a place for posters, the Pyramids would soon "shut up"
Waterloo Bridge. Noses and Son alone doubtless would engage one entire
side of Ptolemy's, whilst Jullien would cover Cyphreus with a monster
broadside.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course all caravans would be superseded, and camels only used for
picnics and penny rides at fairs. The once-renowned Ben Haroun ad Deen
will be waiting to comfort the hungry passenger, crying aloud as he stands
beneath the glorious Sphinx, "Allah is good!—Baked 'taturs all hot!—and
Mahomet is his Prophet. Here's your prime flowery sort!" Whilst the
once bloodthirsty Ben Hassan, as he leans against the bright gas-lit Cleopatra's
Needle, will lift up his voice with "May the Prophet bless you. Ham
sandwiches a penny."</p>

<p class='c000'>The salutary effect that this mixing of the English with the Egyptian
will have upon our Poetry and Romance, "can be much better imagined than
described,"—as George Robins used to say in every one of his advertisements.
Instead of our trumpery "Wilt thou love me then as now?" and "Yes,
dearest, then I'll love thee more!" we shall have good wholesome emotion,
and "no nonsense," in the shape of the following little Anglo-Arabian snatch:</p>

<p class='c000'>"For thirty days I could not eat—neither have I slept for the fleas and
excessive weeping.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Her face is like the full moon, her hair like capsicums, and her nose is
the finest of Grecians.</p>

<p class='c000'>"She moveth like the willow branch, and she speaketh Coptic with a pure
Pyramidical accent.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Her breath is like ambergris; she hath rubies and pearls, and jacinths,
and heaps of red gold in the consols."</p>

<p class='c000'>This is sterling affection if you like. There are few Englishmen who
could keep a flame burning for thirty days.</p>

<p class='c000'>When all these things are worked out, it will be time to begin agitating
for that great moral change, the introduction of Polygamy into England. If
true-born Britons are to be forced still to continue monogamists, what, we
would ask, is to become of the surplus lady population? Either they must
be induced to emigrate in a body to the Grand Sultan, or an act must be
passed to make bigamy according to law. Something <em>must</em> be done for as
matters are at present our wives <em>are just one too many for us</em>.</p>

<p>BLOWING UP ONE'S WIFE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 class='c007'>ALL A-BLOWING! ALL A-GROWING!</h3>

<p class='c008'>At the time of the French Revolution it was the fashion for ladies to wear
their dresses as tight round as pillow-cases; but now-a-days all is confusion
and bustle. That plaguy half-moon thing has set the ladies' dresses swelling
and swelling, till it will soon take as much stuff to make a skirt as it does
to make a tent. Forty years back a "full dress" would go comfortably into
a bandbox, but now it is only with a great deal of pressing that more than
one can be squeezed into an opera-box.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was bad enough when "ye faire damezelles" had hoops all round, like
sugar casks or painted posts; but now they are encompassed with air-tubes
big enough for an atmospheric railway, and it is high time for the husbands
to meddle with what they don't understand, and pick the ladies' dresses to
pieces. In ten years, unless an Act of Parliament is passed to prevent the
spread of feminine dresses, ladies will be such "awful swells" that there will
be no coming near them. Husbands, to obtain the least "peace and quiet,"
will be obliged to blow their wives up not less than three times a day. Ladies'
maids will be required to have lungs like an ironfounder's blast; for if, when
Mary is directed to puff her mistress up into a "good figure," she cannot
blow her out "nice and full," of course she will be told to suit herself with a
place where "good wind" is no object. What a dreadful situation it would
be for a poor dear lady of fashion if any one should call when she's <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en déshabillé</span></i>—and
consequently, by mere force of contrast, as thin as a Passover biscuit.
There she would be running about the house wringing her hands, either promising,
like a true Christian, to give a kiss for a blow, or else crying, like the
lady with the Mackintosh life-preserver in a storm at sea, "Oh dear! Oh
dear! Will nobody blow me out? Will nobody blow me out?"</p>

<p class='c000'>One thing is certain; our parties will soon become literal "<em>spreads</em>," and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>sink into very dull affairs, for there will be no dancing, since it will be physically
impossible for more than one to stand up at a time. The hornpipe—sailor's
or college—is the only English <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pas seul</span></i>, and <em>that</em>, we are afraid, would
not exactly suit either Almack's or the ladies.</p>

<p class='c000'>If those dreadful "dress-extenders" come into fashion, flirting assuredly
must go out. It will be impossible for gentlemen, if the dear creatures keep
them at such a distance—at the very <em>outskirts</em> as it were of their soul's idol,
to come within the mortal range of the very best aimed eyeballs. A squeeze
of the hand will be as rare as a squeeze at Vauxhall. The supper room on
the night of a "grand spread" will be a curious place. There the gentlemen
will stand, armed each with a long baker's peel with which to hand the
ladies their refreshments. The greatest nicety, however, will be required in
presenting a trifle, a glass of wine, or a jelly by these means, lest the whole be
deposited in the fair creature's lap. Still if the ladies will persist in blowing
themselves out before they come, they must not complain that they cannot
eat anything when they are nearly bursting.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would require the great prophet Moore himself to foretell all the mischief
to come unless these gowns are taken in a reef or two. If a cry is raised
against advertising carts for blocking up a street, what noise will the city men
make to a skirt stopping the way like a dead wall! No doubt this last fact
will be taken advantage of by every bill sticker in London, and many a poor
dear, on returning home, will find she has been walking about all day with a
three-sheet poster behind her, announcing there then were "<span class='sc'>Immense Attractions</span>,
and had been entirely re-decorated and painted."</p>

<p class='c000'>The omnibus drivers, too, will throw up their reins to a man, unless,
like Pickford's, they are allowed to charge according to size and weight, and
their licences are altered from "thirteen people" to "two skirts" inside. But
the most frightful picture for contemplation is, in the event of another French
Revolution, what will become of the women? With those dresses they are sure
to be seized for making barricades with. Three or four ladies, a carriage, and
a pianoforte or two, would be better than all the paving-stones in Paris.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ladies had better be careful, or the gentlemen in revenge will introduce
the old Dutch costume.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>THE LORD MAYOR IN IRELAND.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It is sad pity the City of London broke off their bargain about the
Connaught waste land. Everybody was waiting for the fun, when his
Civic Majesty should pay his state visit to the Kingdom of Bogs that
he had added to that of Gog's. How the "boys" would have laughed
to see the whole procession stick fast in the mud, and the man in armour,
weighed down in his own scales, sink up to his helmet in the swamp.
How the "finest pisinthry" would have cheered to see the gilt coach,
Lord Mayor, Recorder and all, suddenly disappear in the illigant muck.</p>

<p class='c000'>In compliment to his new subjects, the Emperor of all the Bogs and
Gogs, of course, would have ordered the faithful Birch (for spare the
birch spoil the "boys") to supply a "feast" replete with every Irish
delicacy of the season. The bill of fare for this most probably would
have been, <em>First Course</em>—Praties wid de bones in 'em; <em>Remove</em>—the
smallest taste in life of salt mate, to make the poteen come like a
"rale blessin." Then to win the hearts of his new subjects the King
of Cockneydom would, doubtlessly, have spoken in the richest brogue
he could manage. At Donnybrook he would have chucked all the girls
under the chin and called them "<em>Macrees</em>," and "<em>Astores;</em>" and delighted
the men by flourishing his shillelah and crying "Och! Goroo!
Goroo! Tare an 'ouns will nobody thrid on the tails of my gownd?"
while, to complete the thing, he would have directed the "Mace-bearer,
darlint, to feel round the tint for the bald hids of the Aldermin."</p>

<p class='c000'>Realty our London <em>Mayors</em> are almost as strange animals as the
Irish Bulls.</p>

tasted Champagne for the last six months. There isn't a man in <span class='sc'>Beds</span> that
dreams of hunting more than twice a-week, and <span class='sc'>Oxon</span>, nearly mad from being
driven so hard, has scarcely a dozen families in which the French language
is spoken.</p>

<p class='c000'>The great question of what will become of the British Farmer has been in
part answered by Mr. Hiceter, who has become—insolvent. It appears that
gentleman has for some time expected the Ploughshare of Distress to cut up
his hearth, and the Harrow of affliction to dig its teeth and nails into the
bosom of his family. This he has long anticipated, on account of his not
having paid any rent for the last two years—indeed from the fact of farming
seldom <em>paying</em>, Mr. Hiceter had long since learned to look upon the agricultural
business as an extensive <em>field for hoeing</em> (owing). Mr. Hiceter complains
that he has suffered much from his kidneys, which have been diseased
for these last two years. His barley, he says, has run to nothing but beard.
His ears, however, have been remarkably long; still, his corn has been so
bad of late, that it has been as much as he could do to hobble on for this long
time. Two large fields of Mangel Wurzel have been swallowed up by a
<em>Native de Paris</em>, whom he engaged to perfect his daughters in the French
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>tongue; and the whole of his six acres of canary seed have gone to teach the
girls singing.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sympathy of the country for miles round has been raised on behalf of
the Misses Hiceter. Their accomplishments are such that if they were not
born, at least they have been bred ladies of quality. In the midst of their
sorrows they find great comfort in the use of the globes. They do not complain,
but pass their time singing Italian duets, and they have already worked
several superb ottomans. Their extreme repugnance to the disgustingly
early hours, and vulgar laborious offices of a farm life, completely reconciles
them to their present condition of having nothing to do. They also feel
great consolation in knowing that in future they will be able to appear every
evening in "low-necked dresses," without being pointed at by the ploughboys,
and to dine at the much more civilized hour of seven, without being called
proud by the Goodies.</p>

<p class='c000'>In their prosperity it was ever the object of the Misses Hiceter to ennoble
and refine the low manners and customs of the British Farmer. It was
through their exertions that their brother, Mr. Albert Hiceter, was induced
to wear a diamond ring and yellow kid gloves whilst guiding the plough.
Whistling at the plough was also strictly forbidden by them among the farm
servants, and white berlin gloves and meerschaum pipes rigorously insisted
upon.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is very gratifying to learn that these two young ladies have made up
their minds to marry only persons of independent fortune and title, and to
leave their papa as soon as they conveniently can, unless he consents to
forego his filthy clay pipe before company.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>BREACH OF PROMISE.<br /> <span class='sc'>Ogles</span> <em>v.</em> <span class='sc'>Winkin</span>.</h3>

<p class='c008'>On the day appointed for the trial of the wretched man <span class='sc'>Mike
Winkin</span>, the rush of ladies was so terrific that, we regret to state, several
highly respectable females met with severe accidents. <span class='sc'>Mrs. de Smythe
Smith</span> had her bonnet completely crushed, and her body literally torn
from her. She was carried to a shop in the neighbourhood, where her
head was immediately dressed; her body, however, was found to be so
injured that it was thought advisable to take it off. <span class='sc'>Miss Beeves</span>, we
are sorry to say, also lost both her legs, they having been taken from
under her in the scuffle.</p>

<p class='c000'>The greatest praise is due to <span class='sc'>Mrs. Inspector Dakin</span> of the T division,
who kept up a constant and strong supply of that body.</p>

<p class='c000'>At ten o'clock <span class='sc'>Mrs. Serjeant Blubag</span> took her seat on the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fauteuil</span></i>.
She was attired in a robe of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poult-de-soie rose</span></i>, trimmed with <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peau de
lapin blanc garnie de demi queue de chat noir</span></i>, and with her hair
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au cactus</span></i>. On the "devotionals" beside her were seated the <span class='sc'>Misses
Justice</span>, <span class='sc'>Tracts</span>, and <span class='sc'>Gruel</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>The prisoner on being brought in was assailed with cries of "You
brute! Oh, you brute!" which drowned the call of Miss Asthma the
usher, for "Silence, my dears! Pray, silence, my dears!"</p>

<p class='c000'>Miss Wartz, Q.C., the celebrated authoress of the "Trials of Women,"
assisted by fifteen other ladies, appeared for the prosecution; and, having
laid down a lovely pair of braces that she had been engaged in working,
opened the case by saying that—</p>

<p class='c000'>In the whole of her born days she had never heard of such a downright
cruel affair.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ever since she had worn a filthy disgusting wig that covered her
"seat of reason" with horse-hair.</p>

<p class='c000'>What on earth had come to the gentlemen lately was really more than
she could say.</p>

<p class='c000'>But men's <em>suits</em> now-a-days were so plentiful that it was the third
time she had appeared in breeches that day.</p>

<p class='c000'>Really, marriage was made such game of now-a-days, that,
terrible to tell! Hymen had completely extinguished his torch; for,
as he said, "<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le jeu ne vaut pas la chandelle</span></i>." (Great confusion
and cries of "Silence, my dears! Pray, <em>pray</em>, my dears! let us have
silence.")</p>

<p class='c000'>The plaintiff in this case is a very good young woman, in the prime
of life, and the pastrycook line;</p>

<p class='c000'>Whose manners are lovely, morals excellent, character superb, and
eel pies divine.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early each morning defendant would seek out her shop, and stop there
the whole of the day.</p>

<p class='c000'>Paying, the great big silly, nothing but compliments for emptying
the whole of the stale-tart tray.</p>

<p class='c000'>But his promises proved only pie-crust; for he suddenly left her to
make love to a cook-shop next door.</p>

<p class='c000'>After having sworn the fondest devotion, and lived on her eel pies
for a good six months or more.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>And now he sends her a nasty impudent letter, saying, carrots are
things he cannot a-bear;</p>

<p class='c000'>Though, as the poor fond dear said, she was ready to <em>dye</em> for his
sake, the very moment she heard he didn't like nice warm auburn hair.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Sniggles was called as witness. She objected to say how old
she was. Might be forty—might be twenty. On her oath, she wasn't
sixty. <em>Would</em> swear she wasn't fifty-nine. Was perfectly well aware
of the consequences of perjury; and yet <em>would</em> persist in affirming that
she had not reached her fifty-eighth year. Objected to answer any more
questions as to age. (Objection allowed.) Knew plaintiff. Had called
to see her, and found the poor thing fainting. She came to a little
when the chemist's young man tickled her. Plaintiff hadn't eaten
enough to lie on a fourpenny-piece ever since. Wouldn't swear to a
fourpenny-piece.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this point of the case, the forewoman of the jury stated to her
Honour that their minds were perfectly made up as to the guilt of the
prisoner: whereupon Mrs. Serjeant Blubag proceeded to put on the
black cap. It was of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crêpe noir</span></i>, splendidly trimmed with artificial
flowers of rosemary and rue, and had a very <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">distingué</span></i> and solemn
effect. Her Honour dwelt for a considerable time on the wretched
man's impudent expression of countenance, asking him in a most impressive
manner where he expected he would go to, and concluded by
sentencing him to marriage and hard labour for the remainder of his
days, as hanging was too good for him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The defendant was then removed in the custody of Mrs. Twentystone,
the turnkey, and an old maiden lady of a serious turn of mind was
immediately sent for, to prepare the man for his wretched doom.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>THE HAPPIEST DAY OF MY LIFE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The Ancients certainly made a great mistake in not choosing Niobe for the
Goddess of Marriage. Hymen is by far too jolly; he is all smiles—more of
the hyena than the crocodile; whilst Niobe is just as she ought to be—all
tears.</p>

<p class='c000'>There never yet was a marriage that was not a perfect St. Swithin affair.
No one—unless he has a soul of gutta-percha, thoroughly waterproof—should
think of going to a wedding with less than two pocket-handkerchiefs; and,
even then, a sponge is better adapted to the "joyful occasion." Men take
wives as they do pills, with plenty of water—excepting, indeed, when the
"little things" are well gilt.</p>

<p class='c000'>If a kind of matrimonial barometer were kept in each family, and its daily
indications as to the state of the weather at the fireside accurately registered,
we have no doubt that on the average being taken the following
results would be arrived at—</p>

<table class='table1' summary=''>
  <tr>
    <td class='c010'><span class='sc'>Before Marriage</span></td>
    <td class='c034'><em>Fair</em>.</td>

    <td class='c010'><span class='sc'>During Marriage</span></td>
    <td class='c034'><em>Wet</em>.</td>

  <tr>
    <td class='c010'><span class='sc'>After Marriage</span></td>
    <td class='c034'><em>Stormy</em>.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c000'>Meteorologically speaking, it would be highly interesting could we arrive
at a knowledge of the exact amount of "doo" prevailing during courtship.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nobody can feel more truly wretched than on the happiest day of his life.
A wedding is even more melancholy than a funeral. The bride weeps for
everything and nothing. At first she's heart-broken because she's about to
leave her Ma and Pa; then, because she hopes and trusts Chawles will
always love her; and, when no other excuse is left, she bursts into tears
because she's afraid he will not bring the ring with him. Mamma, too, is
determined to cry for the least thing. Her dear girl is going away, and she
is certain something dreadful is about to happen; and goodness gracious!
she's forgotten to lock the dining-room door, with all the wine and plate on
the table, and three strange greengrocers in the house. At church the water
is laid on at <em>eye</em>-service; indeed, the whole party look so wretched, no one
would imagine there was a "happy pair" among them. When Papa gives
away his darling child, he does it with as many sobs as if he were handing
her over to the fiercest Polygamist since Henry the Eighth—instead of
bestowing her upon one who loves his "lamb," regardless of the "mint" sauce
that accompanies her. The bridegroom snivels, either because crying's catching,
or because he thinks he ought, for decency's sake, to appear deeply
moved; and the half-dozen bridesmaids are sure to be all weeping, because
everybody else weeps.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<p><em>The Happiest moment of my life</em>——</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>When the party return home, however, the thoughts of the breakfast
cheer them up a little; and the bridesmaids, in particular, feel quite resigned
to their fate. As if they had grown hungry by crying—or the tears had
<em>whetted</em> their appetites—they drown their cares for a while in the white soup-tureen.
The champagne goes off, and goes round. Eyes begin to twinkle,
the young ladies get flushed, and titter and giggle with the bridegroom,
until at last the "funny man" of the party begins talking of the splendid
gravy spoon he means to give when he's a godfather; but is immediately
frowned down by the old aunt opposite, who has come dressed out as gaily
and as full of colours as an oilman's shop-front.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the father gets up, and after a short and pathetic eulogium upon the
virtues of that "sweet girl," whom he "loves as his own flesh and <em>blood</em>,"
thumps the table, and tells the company that "any one who would not treat
her properly would be a <em>scoundrel</em>!" Upon this everyone present turns
round to look and frown at the wretched villain of a bridegroom, and then
they all fall to weeping again. But so strongly has the feeling set in against
the new son-in-law, that it is only by a speech full of the deepest pathos,
that he can persuade the company that he has not the least thought of
murdering, or indeed even assaulting his wife.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last the mother, bride, and bridesmaids retire to say "Good-bye," and
have a good cry altogether upstairs. Then the blessing and the weeping
begin again with renewed vigour. As at Vauxhall, they seem to keep the
grandest shower for the last. The bridesmaids cry till their noses are quite
red, and their hair is as straight as if they had been bathing. And when
the time comes for the happy pair to leave, in order to catch the train for
Dover, then the mother, father, sisters, brothers, bride, bridegroom, bridesmaids,
and every soul in the house, all cry—even down to the old cook
"who knowed her ever since she were a babby in long clothes"—as if the
young couple were about to be "transported for life" in the literal rather
than the figurative sense of the term.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>"FEMALE EMIGRATION."</h3>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Sidney Herbert has forced upon us a great
fact—an uncomfortably great fact—it is thrust into
our brain like a fat thirteenth into an omnibus—we
are alarmingly overstocked with lovely women;
there is a perfect glut of angel purity. Our drawing-rooms,
we are told, are choked up with book-muslins;
and who would not weep to behold the despairing
virgins forced to "polk," "waltz," and "quadrille"
together. Glance down the longest of our very long
drapers' shops—is it not dreadful to contemplate
the two endless rows of bonnets? Even the few
hats that you do see in such places belong to swains
that have been dragged there with smiles and
coaxings—lambs led by garlands to the sacrificial
counter.</p>

<p class='c000'>And what is the consequence? Our youths are
pursued by clever mammas, and hemmed in by
desperate daughters. Embroidered braces, worked
cigar-cases, and beaded pen-wipers are showered
down upon them. Still all the ladies cannot be
married! Bountiful nature has provided two and
a half wives for each Briton; but selfish Parliament
denies them more than one; and no Englishman—however
sanguine—can expect to be a widower
more than twice.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>

<p class='c000'>But great times produce great men, and at this
sad crisis Mr. Sidney Herbert steps forward to

of the wifeless!</p>

<p class='c000'>Already have a few shipments been made on speculation, and they have
answered beyond all hopes. We give the advices received of the last cargo.</p>

<p class='c000'>"<em>Per the 'Orange Wreath,' 400 tons. Lovit, Commander.</em></p>

<p class='c000'>"Seventy cwt. of serviceable spinsters averaging twelve stone, warranted

the waist are in great demand. Black eyes (very superior jet) are freely disposed
of; and red hair, well oiled, at prices slightly in advance of the raw
material."</p>

<p class='c000'>An emigration mania has seized upon the ladies. Every spinster in and
out of her teens is sighing for the land where husbands are to be as numerous
as dead flies in a grocer' window. Paris bonnets are being soldered down in
tin cases, and low-necked dresses are "run up" in a night—like mushrooms.
Wedding-rings are bought up for fear of accidents, and the marriage service
is rehearsed every evening before going to bed.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the desire for emigration among females is not stopped, England will
soon be like a bee-hive, with only one female in it, and that—the Queen.
Only wait a year—a little year—and then do not be startled to find "The
Bridesmaid" leaving early in January so full of virgins as to be obliged to
"let out her stays" before she can "take her wind" properly. Every month
hundreds of our daughters (of course we speak figuratively) are hurrying to
the Australian shores to get settlers for life. Before age shall have made our
whiskers bushy, London will be womanless. Let us grow prophetic and show
what will happen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Half the linendrapers' shops are closed; Waterloo House is "to let;"
Sewell and Cross' has become a cigar divan. Oh this female emigration
mania! We'll give the committee another ten years, and then let our un-darned
socks be upon their heads. When at last we have become a nation of
shopkeeping monks, Government will have to take the matter in hand.
Ladies will have to be imported to supply the place of the exported; our fleets
will be obliged to scour the seas, touching at every island, till their cargo of
lovely virgins and charming widows be made up, and then—back again to
shirt-buttonless England.</p>

<p class='c000'>No doubt a duty will he levied upon the blooming freight. The love-sick
bachelor, armed with a "tasting order," will hurry to the docks to try the
sweetness of the charming Negresses before taking them out of bond. We
can imagine the diary that will be kept some years hence.</p>

told me of the good old days of the cooks, when a gallant officer was always

Many of our bold troops have not smoked for months; they miss the maid-servants'

<p class='c000'>"I groaned as I walked down Regent Street. All the shops closed. The
crowd round the wax female bust at Rossi's was fearful. Heavens! what a
lovely head and shoulders it has!</p>

<p class='c000'>"Dined at Ned Franklin's yesterday, and had a small piece of pickled
gooseberry pie that his sister had sent him from Australia. He tells me the
subscription among the Mahomedan countries goes on well. The Grand
Turk was moved to tears at our situation, and subscribed twenty of his wives
on the spot. Bless him! Bless him!</p>

<p class='c000'>"Fluffy has been obliged to lock his wife up in the cellar. His door was
broken open yesterday <em>ten</em> times by the adoring multitude. All over his

two hundred of us were married, ten at a time. The clergyman fainted. My
dear angelic wife is of a beautiful japan black. I clothed her before introducing
her to my friends. The dear affectionate creature presented me, after
the ceremony, with a joint of her little finger, neatly done up in a piece of

<p class='c000'>"The same symptoms of 'Decline' run through all the bodies of England;
legislative, judicial, theatrical, and even royal. Is it not true that thou art
reducing the salaries of all her ministers, and it is a great question whether
Prince Albert himself will not be put on board wages? Is it not true that
the admission at Vauxhall has been reduced to one shilling, because England's
haughty nobility can no longer afford to pay four? Is it not true that the Queen
has been obliged to pull down a beautiful marble arch in front of her palace
in Buckingham, merely to make Carrara water
out of it? Is it not true that England's
favourite authors, Charles Bulwer, Albert
Dickens, and Sir Edward Lytton Smith, have
been compelled, by the iron pressure of the
times, to publish their works in penny editions,
because the public could no longer
afford to give 1<em>l.</em> 11<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> for them? Is it not
also true that the Omnibuses—those
running barometers of the
social weather—have brought
down their prices to threepence
instead of half-a-crown? Is it
not likewise true that the market
for wives has been so overstocked
lately that the City authorities
are obliged to enlarge Smithfield;
that ices are selling in the streets
for one penny, and pineapples
are being hawked about at two-pence
apiece, because they cannot
be sold at any price in the shops;
and is it not likewise the truth
that Englishmen are
now too poor to give a penny to be shaved, and
that several shops in the New Cut, and the Seven
Vials, are writing up in their windows—I have
seen it myself—'<span class='sc'>A clean shave for one halfpenny</span>'.</p>

<p class='c000'>"These are solemn, rueful, ugly truths, which
show too plainly where lie the seeds of England's
decline.</p>

<p class='c000'>"One more little proof, and I have finished with
this distressing subject, though it has yielded me a
certain malicious pleasure in the investigation of
it. I have just been told that there is not a Stilton
cheese in all London but what is thoroughly
decayed. The fact is as clear as a cup of
(French) coffee. The people have no money
to buy these cheeses, and they have been kept
so long on the shelves of the shops that they
have all gone bad. I point, therefore, with exulting scorn to a Stilton cheese,
and say 'Libellers behold' <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la décadence</span></i> of mity Angleterre. I shall tell my
publisher (Mr. John Bull) to give a morsel of Stilton cheese with every copy
he sells of my book.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>ALARMING SACRIFICE</h3>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>The</span> modern draper's guide to wealth
is a wonderful short cut. Perseverance, honesty,
integrity, and such twaddle have got to be drugs
in the market. To get on the highway of fortune,
you must rush headlong down the Road to
Ruin, continue straight on till you come to the
Insolvent Court, and—there you are. Let business
grow dull, and capital object—like a fat
turtle—to be turned over and over, and the haberdashers
have still the safe expedient left them of
being ruined before taking in their spring goods.
About six "fearful bankruptcies" will make an
enterprising tradesman comfortable for life. There
is nothing like "dreadful failure" for insuring complete success, and
selling off at the most "frightful loss" is the cleverest way of getting the
very handsomest profits. As for a shopkeeper writing up over his door
"established these hundred years," it's sheer madness. He might as well
say at once that he didn't intend selling off at 60 per cent. under prime cost.
His father might have put up such a sign, but the nation has grown wiser.</p>

<p class='c000'>A clever linendraper, who wishes to succeed in business, should look
cautiously at the splendid establishments of his neighbours, and then try to
eclipse them all. If his rival's shop-front reaches to the second floor, let
his touch the third. Double the size of the plate-glass, have fifty times
more brass, and a hundred times more gas, and he will take all their
business away from them as easily as a watch in a crowd. Never mind
the goods, but for heaven's sake look to the French polish! Remember
this—A crust on silver is known to be better than venison on crockeryware.
The "extensive alteration of premises," if well advertised, will fill the
house like the first night of a new theatre; velvets with cotton backs, silks
thin as tracing paper, calicoes half plaster of Paris, will fetch prices higher
than a murderess's ringlets.</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/i_478b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>As soon as this novelty has
died away, an enterprising
tradesman should have a "disastrous
fire," by way of a jolly,
house-warming. Hang up a few
scorched blankets outside the
shop, with a placard stating that
20,000 are for sale, and down
will rush the ladies like sparrows
to a pea-sowing. Dresses
soiled a little in one corner—so as not to show—by the water from the
engines in the back scullery—will look <em>dirt</em> cheap at twice their original
price.</p>

<p>ALARMING SACRIFICE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>But the grand <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup</span></i>—the end and aim of a real downright spirited man
of business—is his own ruin. For decency's sake he must defer this until
he has been in business six months at least. With the first-rate poster of
"Frightful Bankruptcy!" up come the ladies, each one with the week's
housekeeping money, to pick up something from the most distressing wreck.
The idea of such a vast concern going to pieces draws down the beauteous
wreckers like an Indiaman on a rock. To keep up the excitement, issue
every Monday morning a notice that the stock "must be sold in a week,"
and go on every month increasing the amount of loss from fifty until it
reaches two hundred per cent. under prime cost. If the tickets to each
article are well scratched through and marked anew, and marked again in
red ink, the success is certain. Three ruins, and a spirited salesman may
change his name, take a Clapham villa, and keep his nag like a gentleman.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_481a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is a cruel thing, but such is the spirit of competition abroad, that defy
it as you will, it is not to be intimidated. Like
goose for dinner, there is no keeping it down.
If Smith and Co. challenge Europe in shirtings,
Jones and Co. challenge the world in sheetings.
Get a good idea and all your rivals instantly
seize upon it; it's positively disgusting.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_481b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The other day a genius in the silk trade hit
upon so excellent a plan, that it is a positive
disgrace to the nation he is not allowed to
patent it. He was in the ruin line (his sixteenth),
and wishing to go to the dogs in style,
advertised in all the papers that, previous to the
doors being opened, a grand scramble of bonnets
would take place. Thirty thousand Dunstables
would be positively thrown away into the gutter from the first floor. Of
course the attendance was terrific. A band was engaged, and at night the
shop was illuminated, and
the word "ruin," in blood
red lamps, appearing over
the shop-door. With the
first shower of bonnets the
scene was exciting in the
extreme, the music playing
"Hurrah for the bonnets so
new."</p>

<p class='c000'>A most shameful piracy
of this touch of mercantile
genius has already taken
place. The firm of Smith
and Co. have advertised a
grand scramble of left-handed
gloves on Monday, and the right-handed ones on Tuesday. The house of
Green and Co. have announced that, previous to their annual ruin, they
intend to give a grand raffle for three hundred silk gowns, with leg-of-mutton
sleeves and trimmings. Doubtless some firms will shortly imitate
the plan of gambling-houses, and hand round wine and cakes to the customers,
and by this manœuvre perhaps a lady might see double, and take six yards
instead of twelve.</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>
<img src='images/i_482a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Moreover, why allow the ruin principle to rest with the mere announcement
of the fact, why not act a little melodrama or so to make the
destruction more real and palatable. Thus the enterprising tradesman might
take a hint from the plague of London, and when a carriage rolled by, or a
crowd collected at his shop front, he might throw up his window, wring his
hands, and scream, instead of
"death! death!"—as of old—"ruin!
ruin! despair!"
and then disappear suddenly.
Or why not, when the shop
was crowded, let the shop-walker
(who might be a
leading tragedian engaged for
the express purpose) suddenly
rush down the middle,
with his shirt collar open,
followed by six despairing clerks, and holding an empty pistol to his forehead,
which, after a desperate struggle, he might allow them to wrest from
him. This would certainly succeed.
Again, what a grand effect would
be produced by letting an advertising
cart perambulate the streets, surmounted
by a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tableau vivant</span></i> of the
luckless linendraper, having his
bed taken from under him by the
sheriffs' officers, his wife and six
interesting children weeping over
him, and the whole surmounted by flags of posters announcing that the
effects were selling off at desperate prices. In the evening there must be
a transparency of "Despair seizing the till," and a grand display of fireworks
from the attics on closing the shop at midnight previous.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_482b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>After all, perhaps, the linendrapers are not more to blame than lovely
woman. She drives them to the despair they glory in. Let the fond mother
see her Tommy want shirts, and she will, like a prudent body, wait for the
next bankruptcy rather than visit some house where honest prices prevent
clap-trap trickery. But no! there is a moment's vain-glory to be had, a few
words of praise to be earned, when, untying the brown paper parcel before
the wondering husband, she can hold up the bargains that could "never
have been made for the money."</p>

<h3 class='c007'>TO THE EDITOR OF "THE COMIC ALMANACK."</h3>

<p class='c008'>Sir,—I reside near a place of popular amusement "al fresco." I am of a
cheerful though quiet disposition, and should be perfectly happy but for one
circumstance. During the entire summer season I am in a continual state
of terror from Balloons.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was into my front garden that the Ourang-outang descended in a parachute,
in 1836. I then said nothing of the annoyance caused by the mob rushing
into my lawn and scrambling for fragments of the machine, of the destruction
effected among my crockery by the animal attempting to escape through my
scullery, nor of the alarm which his sudden appearance in the dining-room
excited in the bosoms of myself and family.</p>

<p class='c000'>I thought the Balloon mania had reached its highest pitch—no such thing,
sir. After that, came the Nassau Balloon, which used to take a dozen people
up at once exactly over my house, about once a week; till a terrible dream
haunted me of seeing the whole party discharged into my premises.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, Balloons with Fireworks, waking me up every other night, and
gazing at one of which, out of window, I received a severe blow in the eye
from a firework-case, descending fifteen hundred feet perpendicularly.</p>

<p class='c000'>My next alarm was occasioned by a hamper of champagne, which, during
a "perilous descent," when a valve gave way, some intrepid aeronaut pitched
through my roof at midnight.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, folks go up on horseback. Can I walk at ease in my garden, and
know that the veteran Green is three miles above me, performing equestrian
feats in the air? Pray, sir, exert your influence in my behalf, or we shall
shortly hear of a "Terrific Ascent in a Cab," to be eclipsed by "First Ascent
of the Monster Balloon, taking up the Pimlico Omnibus."</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>OUR PET THIEF.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In making some inquiries relative to the state of the criminal population,
my husband found it necessary to visit a low lodging-house,
the abode of thieves and pickpockets. He there became acquainted
with "Dan," and (from his returning some money that was given
him to change) took such a fancy to him, that he determined to try
whether the lad, who had resisted the temptation (for he could have
gone off with the money with great ease), could not—if taken from
his wretched and demoralizing associates—be induced to withstand
all other temptations.</p>

<p class='c000'>The boy (for he was but fourteen years of age), on being questioned,
expressed a wish to change his mode of living, and he was
brought home to me. When my husband told me what motives he
had in taking charge of the lad, I must confess that in the impulse
of the moment I thought it a worthy thing to do; for in my innocence
I imagined that all thieves merely wanted some one to take
them by the hand to put them in the way of getting an honest
living.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the evening we talked over a variety of plans for the boy's
reformation. He was to be sent to school and well educated. There
were many good men to be found, we were convinced, that would
feel proud to take charge of him; and when he left school we were
to put him to some trade or other. I really believe, in our own
minds, we imagined that we should live to see him a great man!
Who knew but that he might one day be Lord Mayor of London;
stranger things than that, we both agreed, had occurred to poor
boys. That he would ever return to his evil practices appeared to
us impossible, if we would but look upon him as the good member
of society that we wished him to become.</p>

<p class='c000'>Little, alas! did we then know of the annoyance and trouble our
"Pet Thief" would cause us!</p>

<p class='c000'>The appearance of the poor shoeless creature was anything but
prepossessing. His cheek-bones were high; his hair was cut close on
the top, with a fringe of locks, as it were, left hanging in front;
and he wore an old plaid shooting-jacket, that was black and shining
with grease, and fastened together with pieces of string.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first thing to be done was to make him take a bath. He had
a great horror of washing, and seemed to look upon it as quite a
barbarism. Some clothes were got together by subscription among
the members of the family—one contributing a coat, another a pair
of boots, and so on; but he looked, I think, worse in our things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>than he did in his own. The coat reached his heels, and was so
large (my husband being corpulent) that the boy had difficulty in
keeping in it.</p>

<p class='c000'>We arranged that he should sleep out of the house, so we hired a
bedroom for him at a coffee-shop in the neighbourhood. I thought
I could find him work in the house by day, and so keep him
employed under our own eyes, and prevent his returning to his old
practices and companions until we could get him into some school.
He was so eager to begin learning, however, that I offered to teach
him myself while we were seeking a proper master for him.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a day or two he was quite a "pattern boy;" but he soon got
tired of his lessons with me, and was anxious to be placed at school.
Anything for change: his disposition and previous mode of life
forbade his remaining in one place, or at the same occupation, for
any length of time.</p>

<p class='c000'>The third morning after his coming to us, while we were at breakfast,
"Dan" entered the room, and requested, in a most mysterious
manner, to speak with my husband. He was told that he was quite
at liberty to communicate what he had to say before the family;
but he pointed to me, and replied, "I don't want to speak afore
<em>her</em>," so I quitted the apartment. As soon as I had gone, the boy
told my husband that he <em>must</em> get him to buy him a small-tooth
comb; his head was in such a dreadful state, he said, that he
thought he had better have one directly. When my husband
informed me of the object of the mysterious visit, I felt cold all over;
for I remembered how close I had sat to him during his lessons the
previous day. Then I thought of the children, and began to repent
of ever having admitted such a person into the house.</p>

<p class='c000'>But this was only the beginning of my annoyances with the boy.
My husband thought it would be a good "moral lesson" for our
children to let them know that "Dan" had been a thief, and that
he had been in prison a great many times; but that he had resolved
to become a good boy, and that was our reason for having him with
us. This, however, instead of having the effect intended, made the
children look upon "Dan" as an object of great interest, so much
so, indeed, that they were always wanting, whenever they saw him,
to ask him something about the prison, "whether the policeman
had really taken him away, and whether it was true he had only
bread and water in gaol?"</p>

<p class='c000'>One morning, on going downstairs, I discovered (to my great
horror) our little boy, with his mouth wide open, seated on "Dan's"
knee, listening most attentively to some story. Upon questioning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>the child I found that our "pet pickpocket" had been telling
the little fellow of the fun it was to go "sawney hunting," which
I afterwards learnt was stealing pieces of bacon from shop
doors.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sunday evening after this the cook, who was naturally timid,
had been left at home with Dan alone, it being the other maid's
"Sunday out." They were both sitting very comfortably talking
by the fire-light (for it was winter time) when Master Dan thought
fit to tell the girl all about his previous life. He gave her some
very vivid illustrations of housebreakings and informed her that
Sunday night, when the family had gone to church, was their best
time. He also told her of the many times that he had been in
Newgate, and that once he had been taken up on "suspicion" of
highway robbery; it was an old woman he helped to rob, and he
told of the "lark" they had with her, and of how they had left her
with her hands and feet tied together in a ditch.</p>

<p class='c000'>All these stories so terrified the poor girl that she felt convinced
that the boy meant to take advantage of the tranquillity of that
Sunday evening, "their best time," to serve her as he had done the
"old woman;" so she rushed to the street door in her fright, and
there we found her on our return home, crying and in a dreadful
state of excitement. She vowed that she would quit the house the
very next morning, and she wondered how we could leave her with
a "common pickpocket." I tried to quiet her (for she was a very
good girl, and I did not wish to part with her), by telling her that
we wished to reform the lad; but nothing would pacify her save
his leaving the house; so I told my husband that he must really find
a school for the boy, or we should be left without servants.</p>

<p class='c000'>He accordingly went in search of a school. It was wonderful to
see how anxious the masters were to have the youth, until my
husband informed them (for it was considered but right to do so),
that the boy he wished to introduce to them as a pupil had lately
been an inmate of Newgate. On hearing this they invariably
assured him that there was a school "just up the street" that was
the very thing he wanted. Upon visiting the establishment "just
up the street," however, he found the master was astonished that
the "head" of such a school as the previous one should refer my
husband to him, for he was sure that Mr. ——'s school was the
very place for such boys—nevertheless, as Mr. —— had refused to
take the lad, there was an academy a short distance from that
establishment that, he was sure, would not shut their doors against
him. But upon going there it was the old story over again, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>we soon discovered that it was impossible to find any respectable
establishment willing to take charge of our young thief.</p>

<p class='c000'>We were at last obliged to give up all idea of getting him into
any school, so we thought the best thing to be done was to try and
find him a situation. In the meantime he got tired of the work he
was directed to do, and would sit all day long looking at the fire
without taking the least notice of any one; and if told that he
should occupy himself in some way or other, he would turn sullen,
and mutter something between his teeth about his being promised
to be put to school, and why wasn't he sent to school when that
was all he wanted?</p>

<p class='c000'>I found that my meat began to disappear in a most mysterious
manner. One day the half of a goose went no one knew where.
I suspected "Dan;" my husband was indignant (for he wished to
think the boy had forgotten his bad habits), and said, "It was easy
for the servants to make out that Dan had purloined it." This
annoyed me so much that I did not hesitate to tell my husband
that I saw clearly we should have no peace in the house until the
boy was provided with a situation out of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last the long-looked-for situation was found. It was at a large
wholesale stationer's. The proprietor was made acquainted with
the boy's whole history, and he promised to do all he could to effect
his reformation. But upon Dan's going to him, the gentleman was
so taken aback by the boy's expression, that he sent a polite note
stating—"That he should really be afraid, from his looks, to have
such a character in his establishment."</p>

<hr class='c019' />

<p class='c000'>In a few days afterwards he was on his way to America.</p>

<p class='c000'>The last we heard of him was that he and several "reformed
criminals" from the London ragged schools were "working" (as the
thieves call it) the city of New York. In conclusion, it is but right
I should add that, although the boy while with us was frequently
trusted with money to change, he never defrauded us of a sixpence.</p>

<hr class='c019' />

<p class='c000'>N.B. The above has been written as a hint to certain philanthropic
gentlemen, that the bosom of a quiet family is not exactly the place
in which to foster and reclaim a London pickpocket.</p>

    <div>(<em>From the Ouran-outan Town Journal and Monkey World Gazette.</em>)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A very curious creature, unknown hitherto to the philosophy of
Monkeydom, has been lately brought to this city, and is now to be
seen at the Zoological Gardens. The stranger has been examined
by the most learned citizens of Ouran-outan Town, and particularly
by the President and Scientific Committee of the Society for the
Promulgation of Unintelligible Knowledge; but opinion is divided
as to his probable genus, race, and species. It is confidently stated,
however, that he shows symptoms of belonging to a debased and degenerated
breed of some savage Ouran-outan race, who, cut off from
civilization and refinement, offer now a humiliating example of what
a monkey may come to. The conjecture is supported by a sort of
unintelligible jargon uttered by the animal. He frequently repeats
sounds which may be spelt thus—"johnsmithstrandlondon;" and
"dammeifthesemonkeychapsdontthinkthey'remen;" but upon no
possible rules of philological philosophy can the meaning (if, indeed,
it have any) of this gabble be ascertained. The animal, when captured
by a hunting party from Ape Valley, was covered in a most
ludicrous and absurd manner, by pieces of cloth cut into barbarous
shapes, and presenting a sad instance of the utter negation of all
rules of taste and propriety. He is believed not to have any natural
tail, and so conscious is he of the want that he seems to have
fashioned two cloth artificial ones, in which, by a strange and savage
ingenuity, are placed (or misplaced) pouches, or holes—to be used, it
is conjectured, for hiding his young ones. The animal, when taken,
made no resistance, but seemed considerably surprised, and repeatedly
uttered a sound like "monkeyshaveme," or "monkeysgotme,"
opinions are divided as to which; afterwards he looked steadily
at his captors and distinctly pronounced "sichalotoguys," the apparent
spelling of which was taken down on the spot.</p>

<p class='c000'>Since its arrival at the Zoological Gardens the animal has manifested
signs of decided intelligence. Meat having been set before
him, instead of eating it like a civilized Ouran-outan with his paws,
he produced, from some of his pouches, two strange instruments,
one of a cutting nature, the other furnished with prongs, by means
of which he divided the morsels and raised them to his mouth.
After feeding he now walks round the company upon his hind legs,
in the manner of a rational being; and were it not for his absurd
clothes, his habits of rubbing or brushing his hair, washing his face,
never biting nor kicking, and especially were it not for a sort of
chimney-pot which he wears upon his head, many Ouran-outans
would really be inclined to think of him as approaching, in some
degree, to the verge of a dim and cloudy rationality. At all events
the creature is a matter of enlightened curiosity, and we understand
is likely to form one of the main attractions at the approaching
Exhibition of the Want of Industry of Monkeys of all Nations.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>July 25th.</em>—Determined to ascend the
Jung-Frau mountain, which is totally
inaccessible and impossible to climb. Difficulties
only add fuel to the fire of a
Briton's determination. Was asked what
I should do when I got to the top. Replied,
come down again. That's what everybody does
who goes up high hills. Engaged guides, porters,
&amp;c. Provided ourselves with necessaries, such as
ladders, umbrellas, skates for the glaciers, ropes,
brandy, camp stools, &amp;c., and started. Quite a sensation
in the village. Landlord of hotel with tears in
his eyes asked me to pay my bill before I went. Didn't.
Began the ascent; ground became steepish, as may be
seen by the illustration. Hard work. Suppose such a
gradient would puzzle Mr. Stephenson.
Talking of Stephenson, the
whole party, puffing and blowing like
so many locomotives. Pulled out our
camp-stools and tried to sit down on them.
Ground so steep that we
all lost our balance, and
tumbled down to the bottom
of the slope. Never mind.
Gathered ourselves up, and
at it again. Recovered our former
position, and getting higher, found
the slope still more excessive. In
fact, it was a wonder to me how we
managed it at all. Approached the
glacier region, and found it rather softish. Unpleasant
consequence of which is that the whole
of our party sink up to the neck in half-melted
sludge.</p>

try to crawl to summit. Set to work accordingly.
Dangerous business, but succeeded. On the top
of this tremendous cliff, discovered a vast chasm
or crevice, which appeared to bar all further progress.
Guides in despair. Much
too wide to jump. Looked
down. Crevice did not appear
to have any bottom in particular.
Called another council of war, and at
the same moment a violent squall of
wind and snow sweeping by, put up
my umbrella, when, horrible to relate,
the storm caught it, and lifted me into
the air; the principal guide, who caught
my leg, being carried up also, and in a
moment we were hurried, in the very
thick of the squall, and deafened by its
howling, across the abyss, and landed
on the further bank. The guides on the
other side now flung across the rope,
which we caught, and fastened to a rock, and one of their number,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>unfortunately the heaviest,
proceeded to come across.
The remaining two,
however, not having
strength to support his
weight, he fairly pulled
them into the crevice, so
that we were obliged to
drag up the whole three.
Found that we were now
not far from the summit. Saw
it before us rising in a sharp
peak against the blue sky.
More of the steep slope work.
Guides at last become so dreadfully
exhausted, that I have to
drag up the whole four. Terribly hard work. Nothing but my
splendid muscular development would
have enabled me to go through with it.
Ice decidedly too rough for skating
over, as may be seen by the following diagram.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Close to the summit, when another dreadful
crevice with a high rock on the opposite side
threatens to stop our progress. Surmounted
the difficulty by a daring gymnastic feat, performed
as follows:—Standing on each other's shoulders,
the lowest man let his body incline over the cliff,
so that I, as highest, reached the edge of the opposite
side, and made fast the rope to a projection in the
rock.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus we happily got over, and in half an hour reached
the extreme peak of the Jung-Frau, where we clustered
together, and gave three
British cheers, while half a
dozen eagles flew round and
round us.</p>

<p class='c000'>Had no time to make scientific experiments; but ascertained
that the strength of alcohol is not diminished in any sensible degree
by the extreme rarefaction of the air at great heights. I subjoin
a telescopic view of mountain scenery, as it appeared through my
double-barrelled lorgnette. N.B. I squint.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Having got up, prepared to go down again, an operation which
was performed in a much quicker style than the other. Started
down a slippery slope, and missing our footing,
and not being able to stop ourselves, proceeded
in this manner, down at least 2000
feet, before we were brought up by a ridge of
rocks, composed of uncommonly hard granite,
against which we rebounded like footballs.
Up, however, and at it again. Came to
another difficulty; found ourselves in a
dreadful gully or ravine, with no sort of exit
but a narrow cleft, down which poured a tremendous
cataract, into an awful black and
foaming pool 500 feet below. There was
nothing for it but to fling ourselves into the
torrent, allow ourselves to go over the waterfall,
and take our chance in the cauldron—which
we did, in the manner shown in cut.
The exploit was quite dreadful, from the roar
of the water, and the speed with which we
were hurled through the air, and soused at least 100 fathoms (for
I counted them) into the pool below, where, after we had reached the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>surface, we were whirled about for at least an hour and a quarter
before we managed to emerge. Found
the experience I had picked up in
the Holborn swimming baths of little
avail in descending this cataract, but
was only too happy to escape at any
price. The rest of the journey was
comparatively easy, owing to a very
happy thought of mine. Happening
to see a roundish-shaped avalanche
roll past, remembered the globe
tricks in the circus, where Signor
Sadustini kept his balance on a big
wooden ball going down an inclined
plane. Communicated the notion to
guides, waited for the next avalanche,
jumped on it as it passed,
and went down like winking, always
keeping our places upon the top of
the ball, which gradually increased
to such a size, that it carried off
several châlets beneath us. But that,
of course, we had nothing to do with; keeping our places as well as
Sadustini himself, until the huge
snowball came to a full stop in
the midst of a pine forest, where
we clambered out of the snow,
and after several hours' hard
walking, reached the village,
where we were greeted by a
deputation of the authorities,
headed by the hotel-keeper holding
my bill in his hand, who delivered
an address of congratulation,
and inquired when it
would be convenient for me to
settle. Postponing, however,
considerations of business to
those of festivity, a romantic
rural <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</span></i> was got up in honour
of our return. The happy peasantry poured in from all sides,
singing, "Come arouse us, arouse us, we merry Swiss boys." The
notary had a table in the corner, which is always usual. The
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Seigneur du Village</span></i> and his lady sat on a rustic throne. All the
peasants had jerkins and breeches, and bright stockings, with lots
of ribands, and all the peasantesses had short muslin petticoats
and pink satin shoes. Choosing then, as a partner, the loveliest
and the most virtuous—I was particular about the last—I opened
the ball.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>BLOOMERISM IN FULL BLOW.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The ladies are about to turn over a new leaf, a leaf in the matter
of costume, unprecedented since the days of the fig leaf. Petticoats
are to join hoops and farthingales; and long skirts, having long
swept all before them, are now, in their turn, to be swept into the
limbo of all the vanities.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course, now, breeches, trowsers, and all their <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">synonymes</span>, will
no longer be forbidden words. The tribes of the "unmentionables"
and the "unwhisperables" have had their day. We observe, however,
that certain pretty modifications of the original terms are
recommended, and we are told to choose between "Pantilettes and
Pettiloons". But why not call the objects in question "trowser-ettos",
or, if an Americanized phrase be thought appropriate,
"limb envelopers" or "understanding swathers," might be advantageously
adopted.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is, of course, to be anticipated that the reformed costume will
spread upwards, as well as downwards, in society; giving us an
opportunity of reading, on the morrow of the first ensuing drawing-room
day, that "Her ladyship wore a splendid pair of loud satin
pants, of deep purple, with a double broad yellow stripe running
down the leg, and new patent elastic straps, tastefully embroidered
with gold." At the same time, as it is inherent in the nature of
things, that pantaloons have to be kept up at the waist as well as
down at the ankle, we shall expect to see advertised "The ne plus
ultra ladies' braces," and the "Better than new plus ultra feminine
suspenders."</p>

<p class='c000'>One dreadful question remains unsolved: it looms upon us as we
approach it, and the nerveless pen splutters in the nib. However,
we will make the effort, and state the problem: Given—a horse,
and a lady about to ride it. The lady is in Bloomer costume—the
horse fully caparisoned for a lady in Bloomer costume. Query:
Will the horse have two stirrups; one on the near side, the other
on the off?</p>

<p class='c000'>What the parks and public gardens will be we have confidently
and fearlessly set forth. The mothers, daughters, grand-aunts,
second-cousins, and great-grand-nieces of England, may be expected,
one and all, to abjure the ancient faith of furbelows and flounces.
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cedunt arma togæ</span></i>, says our old Latin grammar, which literally
translated, means, "Arms yield to the gown;" but now the gown
has had its day, and in its turn, yields—not to arms, however, but to
legs. Long was the reign of the proverbialized petticoat; but, like
the speech of a prosy orator, it has been interrupted by the imperative
cry of "cut it short."</p>

<p class='c000'>Still we will not complain, even though Bloomerism may take a
step still further, may aspire to Hessians with tassels, may dare to
sport tops. For, as was sagely remarked by the American editor
"Why, if female society be pronounced a humanizing agency, should
we not endeavour to see as much of the ladies as possible?"</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>THE BATTLE OF THE HARVEST FIELD.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>A brilliant victory has just been achieved by the troops of
General Concord, Commander-in-Sheaf over a formidable field—not,
however, of artillery, but of wheat. The enemy—<em>i.e.</em>, the wheat, was
very thickly planted on the ground, there being hardly room, indeed,
amongst the heads for the insertion of another ear; and upon the
approach of General Concord and his forces, immediate measures
were taken for the attack. The Commander-in-Sheaf drew up his
army in three lines: the first consisting of several brigades of the
gallant Sickle-eers, supported by flanking parties of the Reaping-hook
Light Bobs, and a strong detachment of regular and irregular
Rakers. Behind, and designed to support this division, were the
two celebrated brigades of Light and Heavy Binders. In the rear
were disposed a powerful body of the Royal Horse Harvest Wagoneers.
Scattered bodies of Foot Gleaners were dispersed here and
there, and the refreshment of the forces was amply provided for by
a perfect battalion of suttlers and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vivandières</span>, who, with the most
cool and heroic courage, penetrated into those parts of the field
where the enemy was falling fastest, with eatables and drinkables
for the forces. So certain, also, was the Commander-in-Sheaf of
victory, that he caused hospital accommodation, in the shape of
barns and granaries, to be erected for the cut-down masses of the
enemy, who were conveyed thither by the gallant Wagoneers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The battle commenced at sunrise, by a combined attack from the
Sickle-eers and Reaping-hook Light Bobs. The effect was tremendous.
The enemy could not stand a moment before the sweep of
our forces, who penetrated slowly but surely into their dense ranks,
mowing them down by thousands. All this time the Light and
Heavy Binders supported their comrades with the greatest efficiency
and effect; and the Rakers, regular and irregular, performed prodigies
of valour. Indeed, the coolness of the troops, in one sense
was as remarkable as their heat in another. Every movement was
performed with unflinching steadiness, and not a man fell (by
tripping over a rake) but his comrade stepped into his place (until
he got up again). The Binders also distinguished themselves by
their discipline; and the order, "Form Sheafs! Prepare to receive
Harvest Carts!" was regularly obeyed with splendid promptitude.
The fate of the day became speedily evident. The Corn made no
resistance worth mentioning, but it certainly stood up with great
pluck to be cut down; and by the direction of the Commander-in-Sheaf,
was carried to the receptacles provided for the disposal of a
brave enemy, with all the honours of the harvest field.</p>

<p class='c000'>By sundown the victory was complete. Not an individual of the
enemy held his head erect. On our side there was a terrible effusion
of perspiration, and a great quantity of provisions and drink were
reported missing; but on the whole the Battle of the Harvest Field
may be considered as one of the most advantageous victories ever
won.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>THE BATTLE OF THE YATCHES.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>A truly affecting copy of verses, made by a British Tar in Spit-head
last August, and corked up in a bottle, floated to the end of
the Herne Bay Pier last week. The bottle was speedily uncorked,
in a vague expectation of Cognac; but the finders, discovering that
the only spirit which it contained was the spirit of the verses, magnanimously
surrendered the whole to the board of Admiralty, as
justly and legally appertaining to that body. The Board, having
sat upon the bottle (and broken it), rose as soon as possible after
instructing the First Lord to transmit to us the poetry, with a
polite note, stating how they had come by it, and lamenting that
the poet should have so obstinately adhered to his peculiar mode of
spelling the word "Yacht."</p>

<h3 class='c007'>MODES OF ADDRESSING PERSONS OF<br /> VARIOUS RANKS.<br /> (<span class='sc'>By Our Fast Professor.</span>)</h3>

<p class='c008'><em>A Duke, or other Titled Person.</em> "Now, old Strawberry-Leaves;"
or, as the case may be. An <em>Earl</em> carries Five Balls, and a <em>Baronet</em>
a Bloody Hand, which naturally points out the mode of addressing
the bearers. A <em>Bishop</em> is gratified by being addressed as "Old
Shirt-Sleeves." If the ecclesiastic wears spectacles, it is <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de rigueur</span></i>
to add, facetiously, that you observe his is not a "See Sharp."
An <em>Archdeacon</em> you will, of course, call "Archy;" and a <em>Rural
Dean</em> you will address as "My Rustic." The <em>Clergy</em>, as a body,
you will speak of as the "White Chokers." The <em>Lay Aristocracy</em>
are simply styled "The Nobs." Attention to this rule is requested.
An irreverent young reporter (from Ireland) having recently incautiously
asked an official of the House of Lords "who that Buffer
was?" (indicating a nobleman who was speaking,) was solemnly
answered: "Sir, we have no Buffers here; they are all Peers of the
Realm."</p>

<p class='c000'><em>A Police Magistrate.</em> Before you are fined—"My Lord;" "Your
Worship;" "Your Reverence;" "Your Excellency;" "Your Majesty;"
or whatever title of honour comes readiest to your tongue.
After Justice has done her worst, you will merely allude to your
enemy as the "Beak."</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Your Father.</em> Speaking <em>to</em> him, say, "Guvnor," or "Old Strike-a-Light;"
of him, "The Old 'Un."</p>

<p class='c000'><em>A Tradesman.</em> Your address in this case will depend upon the
state of accounts between yourself and the party spoken to; but an
easy familiarity should generally be preserved; and it is a good
rule, if you wish to please a tradesman, to call him by a name, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>make some allusion, derived from the trickery of his particular
trade. A <em>Grocer</em> you will call "Young Chicory;" or, if a female,
"Mrs. Beans." A <em>Sausage Vendor's</em> shop you will enter playfully
imitating the cry of the itinerant merchant who supplies daily food
to the canine and feline menial. And a <em>Woollen Draper</em> you should
salute with, "Well, Devil's Dust."</p>

<p class='c000'><em>The Waitress at a Restaurateur's, or elsewhere.</em> "Mary, my love,

<h3 class='c007'>THE TRUE HISTORY OF THE KOH-I-NOOR.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div><em>Now for the first time made public, in spite of the most lavish offers</em></div>
    <div><em>to the Author from Her Majesty's Government.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The Koh-i-noor is made of the very best crown glass, and the
workmanship is very superior. It was originally a chandelier ornament
in a dancing school kept by a Mr. Fogrum at Ponder's End,
about the middle of last century. Mr. Fogrum, however, growing
serious, turned his dancing-school into a Newlight chapel, and
preached a charity sermon in behalf of himself. That night two
rascals determined to rob the chapel of the collection, and accordingly
opened the door with a one-pronged fork, and got in. Finding,
however, that the collection consisted only of a penny token, a
card counter, a penny farthing, and a bad half-crown, one of them,
under the impulse of vexation, jerked the half-crown into the air,
when it struck down the Koh-i-Noor from the chandelier—the would-be
thief putting the bit of glass into his pocket as a memento of
the transaction.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day William Priggins, for so was he named, enlisted in
the H.E.I.C.'s service, and presently joined his regiment, the 007th,
at Juggerbadab. Not liking the service, however, he deserted,
blacked himself all over, gave up wearing clothes, and set up as a
Thug. After doing a good stroke of business in this new line, he
was ultimately apprehended by the officers of the Rajah Jibbety-Jibbety,
and, to save his life, offered to give up the Koh-i-Noor,
which he told the Rajah he had stolen out of a pawnbroker's shop
in Whitechapel. The Rajah was at the time in pecuniary difficulties—so
much so, as to have serious notions of coming to London
and taking a crossing, or singing Hindostanee lyrics, with a tum-tum
and his heir-apparent, in the streets. Being a statesman of
great acuteness and foresight, however, he saw that something
handsome might be made of the Koh-i-Noor, and, in the first place,
christened it by that name, it having been formerly called "Bit-o'-Glass".
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>In the Rajah's capital, the city of Huggerymug, resided a
jeweller of enormous wealth, called Tiffin Gong. This man the
Rajah caused to be summoned before him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What is the value of this inestimable diamond?" he demanded,
showing him the Koh-i-Noor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tiffin Gong made his salaam, and after looking at it, replied,
"May the Rajah live for ever, and until the middle of the week
after. The value is eighteen pice," which amounts to three farthings
English money.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Tiffin," said the Rajah, "just look again; and then look at this
bowstring. Is not the value of that diamond just twenty millions
of lacs of rupees?" And he put his hand to his throat, and made
a cheerful choking noise with his tongue.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_513.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>"On second thoughts," said the jeweller, "the value of the
diamond is exactly twenty millions of lacs of rupees".</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah ordered in his Durbar or council, who were smoking
their pipes, sitting on the door-mats in the lobby, and then before
them repeated his question; to which the jeweller, with one eye on
the bowstring, returned his second answer.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You see," said the Rajah, "Tiffin Gong is an excellent judge of
jewels. He declares this wonderful gem worth twenty million of
lacs; he shall have it for nineteen and a half, which is just as though
I had given him a half lac as a present."</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course the Durbar were in raptures at this liberality, and
sung the national anthem, "Bramah save the Rajah!" with the
greatest enthusiasm. As for Poor Tiffin Gong, he saw that he was
but a departed coon, and turned very nearly white with rage and
terror. He had not got exactly nineteen millions and a half of lacs,
but he handed over nineteen and a quarter. Upon which the
Rajah, holding this to be a breach of engagement, retained the
Koh-i-Noor and the rupees too; and when Tiffin Gong complained
of being kept hanging about the court trying to get his own, the
Rajah said he might try another sort of dangling, and so hanged
him literally, and in thorough good earnest.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>Being thus undoubted possessor of the jewel, the Rajah ordered
the Chroniclers and Keepers of the Records to invent all sorts of
stories about the Koh-i-Noor, and to stick them as notes into the
next edition of the History of Jiggerydam, his kingdom, all of
which was done to admiration, and everybody who did not believe
the notes, was beheaded, except a few, who were hanged. The
after story of this wonderful jewel may be soon told. The Rajah
wore it in his nose, but was speedily made war upon by another
Rajah, who was determined to have a grab at the priceless stone.
The Rajahs met in single combat, and were found after the battle
with only a hand of each remaining, a whisker which could not be
identified, and the Koh-i-Noor between them. It then fell into the
possession of the Emperor Mahommed Bung, from whom it was
taken after fifteen years' war by the celebrated Mahratta chief,
Tater Khan. Bung, in fact, had, as a last resource, swallowed the
stone, which choked him; but Tater Khan had it out in no time, as
he said himself, "by the help of Allah and an oyster knife." The
Khan's descendants, who were continually conspiring against each
other, and putting arsenic in each other's curry with intent to get
possession of the bone, or rather stone, of contention, at length fell
into arrears of tribute to their proud landlords, the H.E.I.C., who
at last, backed by the Government, put in a distress, seized the
Koh-i-Noor, and sent it home; when Mr. Bramah, who is no relation
to the idol of that name, made a cage for it, and all the world
had lately an opportunity of seeing it. We regret that all the rubs
which the Koh-i-Noor has received have failed to heighten its
brilliancy, and it is the opinion of those best acquainted with the
facts, that the gem is not brighter now than when Mr. Fogrum
hung up his chandelier in his dancing-school at Ponder's End.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>MRS. BEAKEY'S TABLE (AND CHAIR) TALK.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Well, my love, Charles thought that as I had vowed I would
never marry into furnished lodgings, we had better wait until he
had saved money enough to furnish a house comfortably. I was
sillier then than I am now, and I thought his wanting to postpone
our marriage didn't look much like love, so I sulked. He was
sillier then than he is now, and minded a woman's sulks. He
furnished a house completely from top to bottom, from an advertising
warehouse, and the whole bill came to 29<em>l.</em> 11<em>s.</em> 3½<em>d.</em> We
married and took possession. Here is my diary of the week,
love; I preserve it for any of my young friends who are in a hurry
to marry.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Monday.</em>—Charles, while shaving, rested his left hand heavily
on the dressing-table. It smashed under his hand, he cut himself
severely, and it was a mercy he didn't have his dear nose off. I
flew to the drawers for something to stop the bleeding, and the
keys broke or the locks wouldn't work, and we had to open the
drawers with the shovel. The hay, with which the easy chair was
stuffed, smelt so disagreeably, that we were obliged to send it out
of the room, and, as Anne was carrying it, the chair came in
halves, the back and arms falling away from the seat.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tuesday.</em>—The frame of the looking-glass gave way, the glass
fell out, and smashed the beautiful little French clock dear uncle
Brooks gave us.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Wednesday.</em>—I had a headache, so Charles wheeled the sofa near
the fire for me. Doing so, two of the legs came off. He propped
it up with books, but by-and-bye I heard a sort of frizzling; it was
the glue, which the fire was frying. Hastily removing the sofa, we
divided it between us; Charles fell down with the end, and I got
the back on my poor toes.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Thursday.</em>—The dining-room table suddenly parted in the
middle. The lamp fell on Charles's head (making him swear
sadly), and I received a lovely goose, and all the gravy, in the lap
of my new satin dress. That night the screws of the bed slipped
in the rotten wood, and one side gave way. We came to the floor:
I was sadly bruised, and Charles hurt his head, and used very
strong language against the advertising wretches.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Friday.</em>—One of the brackets of the curtain-rod broke, the curtains,
rings and all, came on mamma's head, crushing her new
bonnet. Getting on a footstool to dust a picture the stool broke,
and I fell against the picture, breaking the glass, and cutting my
forehead. The pole of a music desk came out of the stand, the
candles fell and greased the carpet (which was actually beginning
to lose its colour already), and the book smashed Charles's violoncello.
N.B. Not so sorry about this last.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Saturday.</em>—Moved into furnished lodgings, where we stayed until
we could afford to deal with a respectable upholsterer.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>IRISH AUCTIONS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In consequence of the difficulties and disputes which have attended recent
sales by auction in Ireland, under the Encumbered Estates Act, and otherwise,
the Irish authorities have published an official set of conditions of sale,
framed in conformity with the spirit of business in the sister country, which
are, in future, to be universally adopted there. Anxious to render this Almanack
of as much use as possible to the man of business, the editor has, at
the last moment, found room for this document:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c035'>
    <div>CONDITIONS OF SALE BY AUCTION IN IRELAND.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>I. The highest bidder to be the purchaser, unless some gentleman bids more.</p>

<p class='c020'>II. If any dispute arises as to who was the highest bidder, the sale is to stop
until the parties have fought it out: but if either combatant is killed, he
shall be allowed to amend his bidding for the sake of his bereaved family.</p>

<p class='c020'>III. If after a piece of land has been sold, it cannot be found in the estate to
which it belongs, it shall be taken from the estate that lies most convenient
to it; but the purchaser shall pay the owner of the latter the
full price of the piece thus taken; but this purchase-money shall be laid
out in improving the same. Anyhow, they must settle it between them.</p>

<p class='c020'>IV. If a lot has been wrongly described, such misdescription shall not vitiate
the sale; but compensation shall be granted as may be just. If a piece
of land has been described as a house, the auctioneer shall be bound to
build a house thereon with the money paid for the same: and if it is
not convenient for the purchaser to pay for his purchase, the money may
be borrowed out of the poor-rates. If the vendor or the poor complain
of this, they must write to the newspapers; and if they can't write,
more shame for them.</p>

<p class='c020'>V. The auctioneer shall not be liable to be called out upon any pretence whatever
connected with the sale now about to take place; but this condition
shall in no wise prevent his giving satisfaction in regard to any other
sale, or his conduct in knocking down other lots or bidders.</p>

<p class='c020'>VI. In regard to its being insulting to ask a gentleman to show his dirty parchments,
and make out titles, and all that bother, no title shall be required
beyond the seller giving his word of honour that the title is as good as
possible, and better. After this, if there's any awkwardness, it's a case
for the Phaynix Park.</p>

<p class='c020'>VII. If what the lawyers call "outstanding terms" can't be "got in," they
must stop out.</p>

<p class='c020'>VIII. If it shall turn out that the seller has sold property to which he was not
entitled, and which belongs to somebody else, and the right owner, upon
proper application, unreasonably refuses to give up possession, the
trouble and expense of bringing him to a sense of what is gentlemanly
conduct shall be equally divided between the seller and buyer.</p>

<p class='c020'>IX. If the purchaser thinks he has paid too much, the balance shall be handed
back to the auctioneer, to be treated as liquidated damages, that is, laid
out in claret, to be drunk by all the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonâ fide</span></i> bidders at the sale.</p>

<p class='c020'>X. The auction duty shall not be paid at all, as it only helps to maintain
English ascendancy.</p>

<p class='c020'>XI. Should there be much starvation on the estate, or much difficulty in getting
enough rent out of the tenants, part of the purchase-money shall be
laid out in publishing, in the English papers, an appeal to the charitable.</p>

<p class='c020'>XII. That none of these conditions shall be binding on anybody who disapproves
of them.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_519b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h4 class='c017'>JANUARY.</h4>

<p class='c008'>Another new year! Something will probably happen before long. If it
does not something else will. Look round corners as much as possible; and
don't go to the end of the world, for fear of falling over the edge. Begin new
undertakings which promise to be profitable. A bad month for marrying a
shrew.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>FEBRUARY.</h4>

<p class='c008'>Give no bills in which February is included, in respect of its being so short.
Never pull your shirt collars so high as to run the risk of the nether man's
catching cold. A bad month for hanging yourself—put it off. Eat as much
as you can. If anybody make you a handsome present—take it, and fear
not. One of your friends will cut himself shaving—seek not to know which;
pry not into the secrets of destiny.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>MARCH.</h4>

<p class='c008'>Never take hold of the poker by the wrong end. Go forth into the streets
and gather a bushel of March dust; it is worth a king's ransom. Take it to
the Goldsmiths' Hall, and they will pay you for it—(a king's ransom is
30,000<em>l.</em>, which will be at once handed to you). Spring commences. Cut
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>the pearl buttons off your shirts and sow them in the flower-pot; they will
come up oysters. Avoid the vanities of dress, but do not go abroad without
your pantaloons.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_520a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h4 class='c017'>APRIL.</h4>

<p class='c008'>Lie in bed all this month for fear of being made an April fool. Many
things happen in April. A good month to receive a large legacy in, but
don't reject a small one. Clouds will gather in the social horizon. You will
have a quarrel with your wife, which will be brought to an amicable conclusion
by means of a shawl. Avoid bonnet shops. A bad month to be
bankrupt in.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_520b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h4 class='c017'>MAY.</h4>

<p class='c008'>A merry month. Gather May dew (query: what are you to do with it
when you get it?) Dance round the maypole. On no account dance round
the north pole, or the south. Get your friends to do bills—it promotes generosity
and liberality, which are virtues. Your hat will be blown off—if it be
windy enough, and you don't hold it on. Be obliging; give anybody who
asks, free permission to run pins into anybody else—innocent amusement
ought to be encouraged.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_520c.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h4 class='c017'>JUNE.</h4>

<p class='c008'>A bad month for your house to be burnt down—unless, indeed, it be insured
for double its value, or your wife be in it. When you ride in the Park
and the boys tell you to get inside the horse and draw down the blinds, don't—it's
not seemly. Make money—Pass your bad half crowns. Give your
clean-picked bones to the poor—charity covers a multitude of sins. If a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>comet appears, let it alone; and when it is tired of appearing it will disappear.
If you see a ghost, tell it to stay there; and come for us, and we
will go and look at it.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_521a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h4 class='c017'>JULY.</h4>

<p class='c008'>Walk about in armour for fear of mad dogs. The planetary system this
month will go on as usual; distrust anybody who tells you to the contrary.
Be a philosopher, and have as few wants as possible—cut off your legs, and
then you wont require boots, which you will find to be a saving. When you
sleep in church do not snore; it is disrespectful to the establishment. If you
go to the opera and drop a double-barrelled lorgnette from the fifth tier, and
it cracks a man's skull below, bring an action against his representatives for
the value of the glass. Make yourself comfortable.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_521b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h4 class='c017'>AUGUST.</h4>

<p class='c008'>Events will take place and circumstances will happen; also things will
come to pass. Beware, therefore, and trust the stars. You may have a cold
in the head, and you may not. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tace</span> is Latin for a candle, and things must
be as they may. Avoid apoplexy, give no encouragement to rheumatism,
and, if you are taken ill with typhus fever, don't stand it. Drink not physic
slowly, and take chloroform when you're having your hair cut or sitting for
your daguerreotype.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_521c.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h4 class='c017'>SEPTEMBER.</h4>

<p class='c008'>Go out a shooting; but shoot not the moon, unless you find it convenient.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>A good month for drinking beer, but avoid salts. Recollect what the wise
man sayeth: a bush in the hand is worth two in the bird. Be sage, stuffed
with sage. The time for travelling. If you let your moustaches grow, you
will immediately begin to speak French and German. Get a passport from
the beadle of your parish, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">viséd</span></i> by the turncock. Avoid sea-sickness by
never ceasing eating and drinking when at sea. If you see the devil have
nothing to say to him; he is very far from respectable; cut him.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OCTOBER.</h4>

<p class='c008'>The harvest is gathered, and the barns are full. The best month for brewing—domestic
storms and natural convulsions brewing as well as porter.
Get all you can out of your friends. Make love to pretty women with
money. If you go to California take care you don't dig up brass for gold.
Take heed, the world will come to an end some day; pay your rent if you
are obliged—not otherwise. Avoid breaking your leg in three places, five of
your ribs, putting your collar-bone out, and fracturing your skull.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_522.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h4 class='c017'>NOVEMBER.</h4>

<p class='c008'>The month for committing suicide; avoid it, however, for yourself. Give
your friends presents of rope; if you give them enough, the sage sayeth, they
will hang themselves. Fogs are thick; but the wise man sees through
them. Roads are muddy; but the rich man rideth in a cab. In this month
your hair will grow. Do not be alarmed. Buy the <em>Comic Almanack</em>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>DECEMBER.</h4>

<p class='c008'>Winter commences. Bills come pouring in. Trust yet to the stars. Do
the Income Tax—so saith the moral philosopher. All flesh is grass—but
beef is not water-cresses. Make moral reflections, and pay no bills. A bad
month for paying bills. Give no Christmas dinner; but go to some one's
who does. Receive presents of turkeys, geese, pickled salmon, and cod, with
oysters for sauce. Look out for Saturn in the ascendant in the house of
Mars; and when you see a comet with a green tail, send an express to the
astronomer royal, with a lock of your hair.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <span class='sc'>Sun</span> will be eclipsed the whole year round by the brilliance of the
work the reader holds in his hand. Visible to all the inhabitants of Her
Majesty's dominions, of the United States of America, and of every other
country where English is understood.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <span class='sc'>Moon</span> will be eclipsed, during various portions of the seasons, at the
Princess's Theatre, by a set of opposition Moons to be got up by Mr. Grieve.
Visible to the audiences each night.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Jupiter</span> has been so completely eclipsed by the crack boat of that name
belonging to the Gravesend Star Company, that he has drawn in his rays in
disgust, declined upon his axis, assumed a mean—in fact, a remarkably mean
distance, and generally shut up shop.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Pallas</span> will be eclipsed by Mr. Barry, whose new <span class='sc'>Palace</span> will approach
within eighteen or nineteen years of completion. Visible to the inhabitants
of Westminster from dawn to dusk, and to the population generally, through
any dull medium—say the Estimates.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Other Astronomical Information.</span></h4>

<p class='c008'><em>To convert Astronomical Mean Time into Mean Civil Time.</em>—Beating
being the shortest way to make mean people civil—beat time.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>To find the distance of Terrestrial Objects.</em>—Take a yard measure, and
measure it. Another way, useful if the object be a window, a friend, or a
public character, is to throw a stone at it, and if you hit it, you may be sure
it is within a stone's throw.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>To set a Sun Dial.</em>—Dig a hole in the earth, and set it. Sun dials are,
however, seldom known to thrive much. The Seven Dials in London grew
up in a soil composed of old clothes, Irish, onions, Jews, and Gin; and the
population is still literally celebrated for knowing what's o'clock, with occasional
rectification by the police.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Directions to know the Stars.</em>—Notice whose names are printed largest in
the play-bills, and precede the largest sums in the schedule of a manager
when he goes up to the Insolvent Court. Another way is to notice who play
or sing most carelessly when the house is bad, or look sulky when applause
doesn't come.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>To calculate Longitude from the Meridian of Greenwich.</em>—Ascertain
how often a person has eaten whitebait that season.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE NIGHTINGALE.</h3>

<p class='c008'>A charming songster of this species warbled its nightly music from a high
tree in the corner of my garden. It generally began its jug-jug just after
sundown, when it distinctly whistled the bass solo, "Now nurse and child are
fast asleep," from <em>Guy Mannering</em>. The formation of the larynx prevented
the lower notes from coming out with full effect, but the performance, in
other respects, was perfect. Truth, however, compels me to add, that the
bird did not, as has been asserted, whistle the words. The same nightingale,
when he saw over the garden wall a gentleman staggering along, after a
convivial party, used to whistle "We wont go home till morning," with great
glee. I only observed it make a change once, when the air selected was,
"Jolly companions every one."—<em>William Kiddy, in the Gardeners' Journal.</em></p>

<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>(<em>From the Sydney Morning Herald, 25th December, 1861.</em>)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This colony is a remarkable colony. The ancient gentleman (we
forget his name, and there isn't a Lemprière nearer than Cochin
China), who turned everything he touched to gold, must have called
here on his way to Hades. Gold, gold, nothing but gold. Let us
calmly review what Australia has done since Christmas, 1851.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although she has separated from the mother country, it was not
in anger, but only as a rich child's establishment is naturally apart
from that of poor parents. We did not neglect Old England; we
paid off her national debt, and we deposited in the hands of trustees
(the Emperor Jullien I., King Abbott-Lawrence, and Sultan Abd-el-Kadr)
a sufficient sum to render taxes in England unnecessary for
two hundred years. Having thus done our duty as a child, we
leave the old lady to amuse herself her own way. But we shall
not forget her, and each Christmas we shall delight in presenting
her with a new Fleet, a box of palaces, or some other tribute of
affection.</p>

<p class='c000'>We laid down the Cape and Algiers Railway, as also that from
Gibraltar to St. Petersburgh, and the eighty thousand miles of line
in India. We cut through the Isthmuses of Suez and Panama, and
lengthened the grand canal of Venice to the Black Sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>We bought up all the opera singers in the world at their own
price (the largest drain our exchequer has known), and we founded
the Australian Opera. Meyerbeer received 100,000<em>l.</em> for his opening
work—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Kangaroo</span></i>, and the "Hopping Chorus" is worth the
money.</p>

<p class='c000'>We arranged a financial system for ourselves, the leading feature
of which was, that there should be no fractions, no change, no bargaining
(this nearly drove the women out of the colony), and no
tick. The lowest price of anything was to be a guinea.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have an electric telegraph communication between our new
capital, Aureopolis, and every other metropolis in the world. Painful
as it is to hear the needy creatures of other continents squabbling
about miserable loans and wretched subsidies, when, perhaps,
the whole sum at issue is not fifty millions, and disagreeable as it
must be to regard one's acquaintance as paupers wrangling over
halfpence, the lessons are not without instruction.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such are some of the achievements of Australia. But she is not
all-powerful. We have a failure to record. All her proffered treasures
could not buy one of the writers in the <em>Comic Almanack</em>. Yet
it must be done. Gird up thy loins, young nation! The rest were
trifles, but here is a task worthy of thee. Thy mines of wealth
against the mines of wit; for one of those priceless men thou must
have. To the Diggings! to the Diggings!</p>

Thank evings I'm now a maid man, and a real transported conwict, and no

Pentonwill too ears, and then we kum out here, a hole ship lod on us, rigglar
outanouters as ever stood in a dok, and then they set us to make rods, and
me and Bil Smuth, and Jerry Gibbs—him as knocked the old lady on the
'ead for pleasure, arter the bissines was over, and the swag sekured—and
half-a-dozen more, was all tyed to one chane, with a lot o' sogers ready to
shoot us if we layed doun our piks or spaids for a minit. But let me tell yer,
as things 'as turned out, the praktise was kapital, for suddenly one mornin'
there kame word, that about a dosen of miles from us, there was a bed, a
rigglar bed of gold made up in the earth, and that noboddy had anythink to
do but to stupe down and pik hup the peaces. By gom, Ikey, when the
sogers heard this, off they cut, and set to work at the golden sand with their
baggynets, and, as you may be sure, also off we kut arter them; and there
we wos, the hole wak of us, konwicts and no konwicts, pickin' up the yaller
metal like 1 o'clock, and mindin' nuffin else. And now we found out the
hadvantage of our rod makin praktise, for, for every ounse of gold the rest
piked up, we got a £. So we soon had the chane off, and, in less nor 6
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>wheeks I had for my share at least 50,000 lbs. worth—which, by-the-by, I
am grieved to say, that disonest skoundrel, Bil Smuth, tryed to pilpher from,
but a dig from the pik axe settled his ash, as so it did Jerry Gibbs's, whose
and I found in my pokkits—the unprinsipaled thif, who had no more respect
for reallysed property than nothink at all. And so, to make a long storey
short, here I am, a-goin' to sale for Urope by the next ship with all my gold,
and quite sartin of being reseaved accordin to my merrits, as weyed by the
hevvyness of my Koffers.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have hardly maid up my plans yet, but I think I'll by an andsome ouse
somewere near Tyburnia—I like the name; and I'll call it either "Burglary
Lodge," or "Felony Villa," or "The Fence," and I'll furnish part on it quite
slap-up like the nobses; and part on it like Newgate, and part like Pentonwille,
and part like the Pennytenshiary, just to keep hup a scentimental rememberance
of the old Times. I'll get a Kot o' arms too. The Herralds'
Offis will soon find that for me, but there must be a dark lantern in it, and a
skillington kea, and for a mottar, "Sucksess to Swindlin," in a dead langwidge,
which is more genteeler nor a livin one. In course I'll have an ouse-warming,
when I'll ask the Rekordor of the sitty of London, and the Kommon
Surgeon, and Surgeon Adams of the Middlesects, and the Kommishners of
Pollis, and Dannal Wittles Arvey. I should think they'd come. I don't
bear no mallis, and I'll give 'em good wittles. "Sirkmstances is altared, my
Lords," I'll say after dinner, when I'm a-standing with a glass of champagn
in my 'and, "And I forgive you for having sent me out to Bottiney Bay, konsidering
wot's come of it, and if any of you would like to try your luck akross
the water, I'll give you a letter to a hold pal of mine that worked on the
same chane as me for five ears, and he'll put you hup to the time o' day
if anybody will." I shood think, Ikey, as that would be a 'andsome way
of doing the thing, and letting bygons be bygons. I wudn't be surprised
arter that if they made me a Middlesects magistrate, or a visitin Justass, or
summut o' that kind, and when I goes to a Pollis offis just for old assossiashun's
sake, you'll read in the papers how the Honorable Genlmn was akkomodated
with a seat on the bench beside the worthy maggistrate, Ha! ha!
Ikey, the gold will do it al. I wouldn't be surprised if I get a testymonial,
or if there be a subskription to raise a monyment to me—or a lot of amsouses
for dekayed prigs, to be called "Bullseye Amsouses," with the names of the
churchwardens of the Parritch karved over the entrance door. In course I'll
keep a carridge, which is more convenient than a wan with V. R. painted on
the side; and I'll have the deerest pue in the most fash'nable chapple—Parritch
churches is low—and I'll shubscribe to the societies for the purtection
of property and the shuppression of voice. Its wot is looked for in
men in a sartin position.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sutch then, Ikey, are my present plans. I wud ask you to my ouse
warming but fear you mite not like to meet some of the Gents allooded to,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>you being still in the old line of bisiness, and not unkimmon well of. Howsoever,

<p class='c000'>"For every horse, mule, or other animal, not being an ass, the sum of

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>You've heard of an Habitué—an Opera-going man—</div>
      <div class='line'>Perhaps you sometimes try to look as like one as you can,</div>
      <div class='line'>But, if you want a faithful sketch—correct as sketch can be,</div>
      <div class='line'>I'll daguerreotype myself—an old Habitué.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And first, I don't know music—for I haven't got an ear;</div>
      <div class='line'>And I fear I couldn't tell Jim Crow from strains by Meyerbeer;</div>
      <div class='line'>And once I made a blunder when the band began to tune,</div>
      <div class='line'>And asked what Costa was about, to start them off so soon.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The fact is—music bores one, but what is one to do?</div>
      <div class='line'>It's very clear that one must try to get one's evenings through;</div>
      <div class='line'>And so I somehow find myself professing vast delight,</div>
      <div class='line'>And shouting "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">brava</span> Grisi!"—yes—every Opera night.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I'm got up to perfection. In all that dandy place,</div>
      <div class='line'>There's no cravat so faultless—no shirt so gay with lace;</div>
      <div class='line'>My gibus hat—my shiny boots, there's none who see forget.</div>
      <div class='line'>While words can't tell how tight my gloves, or huge my white lorgnette.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And, every Opera evening, I lounge into my stall,</div>
      <div class='line'>And nod, and smile to scores—of course—Habitués, one and all;</div>
      <div class='line'>And then adjust that huge lorgnette; and, grave as grave can be,</div>
      <div class='line'>From box to box, and tier to tier, commence my scrutiny.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>There's first the row of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">baignoires</span></i> so dark, and deep, and sly;</div>

      <div class='line'>The First tier so respectable—beloved of Russell Square,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Second, where the artist haunts high up in middle air.</div>

    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line'>Whether or no the House be good. Spite managerial wile,</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The curtain up—my toils commence—and loungingly I pass</div>
      <div class='line'>From tier to tier, and box to box, myself, boots, hat and glass.</div>
      <div class='line'>And flirt with Emily, or Kate, and chat with dear Mamma,</div>

      <div class='line'>Who've pinned the bill upon the ledge of Lady Swandown's Box.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But the last loud stirring chorus at length has died away,</div>

      <div class='line'>The corridors are thoroughfares—as here and there they flit</div>
      <div class='line'>Our humming, chatting Opera world from boxes, stalls, and pit.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>For now there comes the Quarter hour when everybody meets,</div>
      <div class='line'>The cheery, chatty Quarter hour, when each some comrade greets,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Quarter hour so terrible, when Critics deep, who sit</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A chattering joking conclave, that merry clever ring,</div>

  <h3 class='c007'>MR. BULL'S GLASS OF WATER.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Mr. John Bull, suddenly impressed with the excellence of water,
demanded that his town mansion should forthwith be supplied.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Bless your soul, Sir," cried nine of his servants, "the house has
water enough, and very good water, brought twice a week."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Bring me a glass of it," said Bull, and while they were fetching
the glass (for John's servants are the dreariest dawdles on the face
of the earth, and are as long opening a door, cleaning a passage, or
doing any little job, except a money job, as the servants of Monsieur
le Nez, over the way, are in throwing his whole house out of windows),
Mr. Bull took up a Blue Book.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Colourless, transparent, inodorous, and tasteless; such are the
conditions of purity in water," read John. "O, here you are at last,
you lazy rascal; give me the glass. What do you call this stuff,
you scoundrel—pea-soup?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Capital water, Sir, stunning tipple, sir," said the fellow audaciously;
"your steward pays me a shilling a pint for all I bring in."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Does he!" said John, glancing across the room, to be sure that
his stick was in its corner. "Where do you fetch this stuff from,
tell me that?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nearest place, in course, Sir. Thames-ditch, Sir."</p>

<p class='c000'>"That all my drains run into! Take that, Sir!" roared the old
gentleman, kicking him down stairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another servant, smirking, ran in with another glass.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Less colour," said John, "but smells like the end of a gas-pipe."
And the bearer went over the bannisters. A third tried his luck,
declaring that the water he brought came from a beautiful tank
near Sadler's Wells.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Full of live things," said John, shuddering.</p>

<p class='c000'>A fourth rushed up, "Try this, Sir; a dodge of my own, Sir, a
pipe from a tan-pit, Sir—tan very healthy."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Tastes of animal decomp——I'll tan <em>you</em>, Sir," thundered John,
planting his fist between the rogue's eyes, "put that in your pipe!"</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, all the other servants came with glass after glass of dirty
water; for fetching which, John Bull's steward was, they said, in
the habit of paying them enormously, besides encouraging them to
beat anybody who came to the house with a filter, or offered to bring
cleaner water at a cheaper rate. John waxed furious, declared they
were all rogues and cheats, and commanded his steward, one <span class='sc'>Wood</span>,
to contrive that he should have decent water. So Wood, who is
the merriest, most goodnatured bungler in the world, proposed that
they should all pour their different supplies into one great tank,
which he thought would make the water pure. <span class='sc'>John Bull</span> didn't
quite see how eight quarts of dirty water would, by being mixed,
make two gallons of clean; but this plan is going to be tried. It
seems most likely that John will never get a <em>Glass of Clean Water</em>.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>OUR OWN PRESIDENT OF FRANCE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The shadow of a coming event has fallen upon the opposite page
and stayed there. It represents the triumphal entry into Paris of
M. Jullien, chosen as President of the Republic, Leader of its
Armies, Composer of its strifes, Conductor of its Bands, and in
general, National First Fiddle.</p>

<p class='c000'>The French having tried all manner of governments and all
classes of rulers, and not liking any of them, will naturally, in their
pursuit of harmony, turn to one of its most celebrated professors.
M. Jullien, on the 1st of April, will issue two public manifestoes,
expressive of his political creed:—"The Universal Suffrage Polka,
with ballot-box and kettledrum accompaniment;" and "The
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Liberté, Egalité, et Fraternité</span></i> Quadrilles," in which all the second
and third fiddles will play the first parts, the piccolos will produce
the sound of ophicleides, and any instrument will be at liberty to
play anything it pleases; all this in token of the equalization of
society, and the freedom of action to be accorded under the new
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</span></i>. The time in which this Quadrille will be arranged is the
Good Time Coming, which may be reckoned a very slow movement,
seeing how long it takes to arrive.</p>

<p class='c000'>These magnificent political <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">morceaux</span></i> having been duly considered
by the people of France, whistled by all the boys, and
danced to at all the casinos—the cry of "Jullien for President"
will become all but universal. The Elysée will be frantic, the
Orleanists furious, and the Legitimists in despair. Louis Napoleon's
friends will meditate a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d'état</span></i>, for the purpose of securing
all the silver plate in France; but which will be defeated by the
counter operations of a conspiracy for the abolition of taxes, and
for giving every Frenchman, above the age of twenty-one and untainted
by crime, a salary of 5000 francs per annum, to be paid
quarterly by the government. In the midst of these conflicting
movements of party, the grand day of election will take place, and
the following will be the state of the poll:—</p>

<table class='table5' summary=''>
<colgroup>
<col width='67%' />
<col width='32%' />
</colgroup>

  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c000'>Each of the three latter gentlemen having voted for himself. France
will be immediately thrown into a state of rapturous delight, and
the new President will land at Boulogne from four steamboats, the
band playing the Row Polka, which will be adopted, till they get
another, as the national anthem of France. What the triumphal
entry into the capital will be, is made manifest on the opposite
page. Welcomed by the universal voice of Paris, in one grand
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">concert monstre</span></i>—the democrats the basses, the quondam Buonapartists
the tenors, the quondam Legitimists the counter tenors,
and all their wives and daughters the sopranos and contraltos—then
there will commence in France the harmonious reign of
M. Jullien—the President without a precedent.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>we have resolved on considerable improvements in the Prophetic department
of our publication.</p>

<p class='c000'>This feature indeed may be said to have been (in proof of which we are
going to say it) hitherto the only unsatisfactory one of our otherwise complete
work—having been confined to the prediction (in six neatly printed
pages at the commencement of the yearly volume) of the particular week-days
on which each day of the month would fall; the number of days to be contained
in each month; the periodical changes of the moon, &amp;c., &amp;c.—predictions
which have invariably been verified; but, from the comparatively uninteresting
nature of the events foretold—considered as a supply to the enormous
demand for Prophetic Intelligence alluded to above—may be open to a charge
of inadequacy.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the Future we intend to be more explicit as to it; and will foretell
events of a more general nature, calculated to set at rest all the throbbing
questions of the day, to which an answer will oblige—only stipulating
that, in the case of any prediction not appearing to be satisfactorily fulfilled,
the reader will withhold his judgment till such time as he shall have purchased
our next number.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our extra amount of foresight has enabled us to present the reader with
sixteen pages of matter more than he has been in the habit of receiving. The
usual blank pages for the purposes of journal and cash entries will be no
longer necessary, the accounts of the year being already made up for him by
ourselves.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>January derives its name from the Roman deity Janus. It is the
first month of the year—following December, and taking precedence
of February. It contains thirty-one days.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have been induced to make the above remarks by the conviction
that no work, however brilliant, has a chance of success in the
present day, unless containing a certain amount of really sound
and valuable information. Considering we have established our
powers in that line triumphantly, we will proceed to foretell the
principal events of the month.</p>

<p class='c000'>On second thoughts though, the month is so absurdly near at
hand, and the events themselves will so soon happen, that it is hardly
worth while. It has even occurred to us that it would be an insult
to our readers—the very notion of which makes our blood run cold!
Of course, under the circumstances, we cannot think of anything
of the kind.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Directions for Beginning the New Year Well.</span>—Go out to
dinner on the 31st of December. Select the best house you know
for the purpose. Eat and drink of the best, and spend the evening
cheerfully. See the new year in, and accept your host's offer of a
bed. Breakfast with the family; be in excellent health and spirits,
and have a legacy left you.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Family Receipts.</span>—Those given by the landlord on the 26th
ultimo are the most appropriate to the month, and should be taken
care of in case of accidents.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>To avoid Chopped Hands.</span>—Have your meat properly jointed by

intimate he is with the new member, whose return to Parliament
he was mainly instrumental in effecting, and who has professed the
greatest attachment to him and his family. He will lie in wait
(bidding his friends to look on) in the strangers' lobby for the new
member. He will see the new member entering the building with
conscious dignity. He will rush at him with extended hand, addressing
him by name. The new member will suddenly see somebody
he wants to speak to, and rush madly away in an opposite
direction. The influential inhabitant will return to his provincial
borough with altered politics.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following national sports will form a portion of the programme:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>

<p class='c000'>There will also be a general run of excisemen and tax-gatherers

<p class='c000'>On Easter Monday, Greenwich Fair will offer its attractions to
an intellectual British public. A great falling off will be observed
in this time-honoured festival. The shows will be found stripped
of their brightest pantomimic and melodramatic ornaments: but
Richardson will not give up the ghost!</p>

<p class='c000'>Parliamentary business will be suspended for the Easter vacation.
Much curiosity exists as to what statesmen do with themselves on
such occasions. A slender middle-aged gentleman, of Jewish
aspect, with an immense quantity of glossy ringlets, will be seen
enjoying three sticks a-penny in the park on Easter Monday. A
much shorter gentleman, wearing a pasteboard nose, and blowing a
penny trumpet, will be robbed of his handkerchief, in the same locality,
whilst getting into a round-about, in company with an
elderly gentleman in plaid inexpressibles and a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">retroussé</span></i> nose. That
handkerchief will be found marked J. R. with a coronet. For once,
we decline being definite, and say nothing.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>APRIL.</h3>

<p class='c008'>The excellent working of the convict system will be summarily displayed
in Australia. The convicts, by a decisive <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup</span></i>, will succeed
in obtaining the upper hand. The colonial executive will be vanquished
and replaced by a provisional government on an entirely
new principle. A new and original code of laws will be organized,
by which honesty will be made criminal, and rascality rewarded.
No man will be allowed to claim any property, unless he can prove
that he has stolen it, and no documents whatever will be considered
binding except forgeries. The Gold Fields will be at the disposal
of the government, who will grant licenses (to be paid for in counterfeit
coin) for the assassination and plunder of the individuals who
have been sent out (officially) to rob the diggers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Emigration will, however, continue unchecked. Labour will be at
an incredible premium. £400 a year will be refused by a groom,
because he is expected to attend to the stable, and refused the use of
the piano. Desertion in the army will be carried to such an extent
that Lord Hardinge himself will be compelled to mount guard at
Folkstone, to keep out the French invasion—his only hope of the
safety of the country being derived from the knowledge that all the
soldiers of the Emperor Napoleon III. have deserted too, and that
that potentate is constitutionally opposed to the ordeal of single combat.
There will be no policemen left. The magistrates themselves
will be compelled to assume the uniform in case of any malefactors
remaining in the country. Mr. Norton's beat will be Westminster
Bridge; that of Mr. Broderip, Vauxhall Road and its environs;
whilst the safe custody of the Borough will be entrusted to the
vigilance of Mr. A'Beckett.</p>

Gardens attached to the bottom of the car of the Globe Balloon
by six penn'orth of wafers only. The veteran Green, by the
announcement of his 8000th ascent, suspended by warranted unsafe
cords, will prove that, in spite of his vast age and experience, he is
not yet old enough to know better.</p>

<p class='c000'>A gentleman from one of the East-end gardens will be indicted

some regard for their precious healths. They themselves (the

<p class='c000'>The fact is, Winkinson has been going
it rather, and the idea of commencing
three months' voyage in such a shaky
state is out of the question. It isn't
every day a man leaves his mother country,
and when there's no prospect of your
seeing each other again for years, it is
certainly excusable.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>

<p class='c000'>You must consider that Winkinson's

ordinary course of things she can't last
long, and his farewell must be a final

<p class='c008'>Several genteel establishments will be closed, the blinds drawn
down, and the drawing-room furniture enveloped in brown holland.
In answer to inquiries, the visitor will be informed that the family
has left town for Baden-Baden, Palermo, the Continent, or
Brighton. Baden-Baden is a small watering-place on the coast of
Kent, known to the inhabitants as Ramsgate; Palermo is an adjacent
settlement, familiarly termed Margate; "the Continent" and
"Brighton" are synonyms for the two-pair back, with the use of
the attics for sleeping apartments.</p>

<p class='c000'>The annual Scottish <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</span></i> will take place in Holland Park.
Several distinguished chieftains will appear in the national

to distribute Bloomer tracts among the assembled Celts,
and bring them to a sense of their trouserless position—but will
not be attended with any great success. In order to eclipse the
daring achievements of former years, a magnificent prize will be
offered to any Scot who will perform the herculean feat of returning
to his own country. There will be no candidates.</p>

<p class='c000'>All London being at the seaside, there will be a greater quantity
of donkeys seen on the sands of Brighton and Ramsgate than
usual. Speculators on the Chain Pier will realize large fortunes
by letting out telescopes to hire during the hours devoted to bathing
by the ladies.</p>

<p class='c000'>On and before the 29th, the great question of Tenant Right will

<p class='c008'>A great many things will happen in October on various days of
the month, at different hours of the day, whose influence will be
felt in numerous quarters of the globe. Nothing, however, of sufficient
importance to be noticed in this department of our publication
will take place. Should anything of the kind inadvertently
transpire, it shall be faithfully noticed in our next number. We
cannot possibly say fairer.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fact is, October is a very uninteresting month. It takes
place at the very slowest period of the year. It comes after the
excitement of quarter-day, and before we have begun to trouble
ourselves about winter. Nothing whatever is seasonable to it, as
it belongs to no season whatever. Nothing can be done with it,
and anything will do for it. We will therefore do nothing whatever.</p>

<p class='c008'>We candidly confess that we are again somewhat thrown back

is difficult to see your way clearly.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have not, however, entirely lost our way. On the 5th, all
foreign refugees wearing beards and extraordinary hats will find
that England does not offer that safe asylum from persecution they
had been led to imagine. They had better keep out of the way,
for fear of being arrested, or, as the familiar Saxon expresses it,
"smugged," in order that political and religious intolerance may
be displayed in the most awful Guys! The wearers of ponchos,

is really an object.</p>

<p class='c000'>On Christmas Eve, Watkins will bring several friends home
with him to partake of egg-flip, assuring them that he always
makes egg-flip on Christmas Eve, because his father did so before
him, and there is nothing like keeping up those good old customs.
The egg-flip will be made—its component parts being table beer,
gin, butter, eggs, sugar, nutmeg, and other bilious materials. The
friends will be compelled to drink an immense quantity of it, and,
when quite ill, will be dismissed by the host calling on Heaven to
bless them, and wishing them a merry Christmas. The friends will
think Watkins the best fellow in the world, and not see for a
moment the bitter mockery of his parting wish.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sowster family will spend Christmas Day admirably. Old
Sowster likes to have all his family about him on this occasion, that
they may be cheerful and united, without the interference of
strangers, at least once a year. He will go to sleep immediately
after dinner, and not wake up till supper time. Jack and Bob
Sowster, disgusted at having had to refuse so many nice invitations,
because the old boy insisted on it, will sulk for the whole day. The
Misses Sowster will pick quarrels with them, having nobody else's
brothers to talk to in a more agreeable manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>Other people will spend Christmas in a more jovial and agreeable
manner. We will for one; and we are sure that the intelligent
reader, holding this volume in his (or her) hand, will for another.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>MORE RAILWAY ASSURANCE,</h3>

<p class='c008'>We have received official information respecting a new bill about to be
brought into Parliament, for the protection of Railway Companies. The following
are among the clauses enacted:—</p>

<p class='c021'>That the directors of any company announcing the departure of a train at any particular
time, may start it an hour later—or two hours earlier—or when they like—or not
at all.</p>

<p class='c021'>That trains announced to contain third-class carriages shall consist exclusively of
first-class carriages; and that any passengers made to wait by these arrangements, shall
be compelled to pay for the use of the waiting-room.</p>

<p class='c021'>That it shall be legal for the officials of any company to stop a train when half-way
towards its destination, and refuse to take the passengers on till they have paid their
fares over again—in which case the engine-driver need not proceed unless it suits him.</p>

<p class='c021'>That in case of collisions, all injury done to the line, carriages, &amp;c. shall be made
good by the passengers—the train having been run for their accommodation. In case of
fatal accidents, the directors may come upon the representatives of the deceased parties
for damages, as compensation for the loss of traffic likely to be caused by the report of
such unpleasant affairs.</p>

<p class='c021'>That no passenger shall exercise any control whatever over his own luggage; and
that no director, chairman, station-master, policeman, guard, porter, engine-driver, or
stoker in any of the companies' employ, shall be responsible for anything whatever.</p>

</div>

<p class='c031'>"The Pastoral, as a feature in English poetry, has long ceased to exist. The Arcadian
characteristics, however, of our Australian colonies—recently brought to light—afford
every excuse for its revival. Pope says something very clever about pastorals in connection
with Theocritus, for which see his works, and find out the passage, if possible. A
great many other writers have alluded to the same subject."—(<em>See</em> <em>British Museum Catalogue</em>,

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>According to my promise, oh, apple of my eye! I dip my
brush in the ink-dish of love, to communicate my adventures in
the land of the barbarian. Tee-Tee! think not I have forgotten
thee—nor yet that it was those little domestic differences (which I
look upon as gnats in the bright sunshine of our wedded happiness)
which made me join that tremendous movement—now threatening
the Celestial Empire with depopulation—and presenting to the
imagination the terrible possibility of the Brother of the Sun and
Moon (may his stomach extend!) being compelled to brush out
his own pigtail!</p>

<p class='c000'>Blame me not for leaving thee in the night secretly. I could not
have borne a parting. I know thy love for me is such that, hadst
thou known my intention, thou wouldst have become frantic—and
I should have been quite overcome. My heart failed me as I stole
past thy bedchamber door on tiptoe; my shins quivered with emotion
when I thought of thy tiny gold-shodden foot; my cheek
burned as thy delicate hand seemed to press against it; and when
I pictured to myself thy long and graceful nails, I was as a man
without eyes!</p>

<p class='c000'>Enough, oh, Tee-Tee! This comes hoping you are quite well,
as it leaves me at present—Fo be praised for the same!</p>

<p class='c000'>Our labours have not yet been crowned with success. I speak
not of the vulgar seeking after gold—to which motives the opponents
of progress and light have basely attributed the Great Chinese
Emigration Movement which has shaken the barbarian world to
its foundation. Thou knowest better. If thou dost not, after all
I have told thee, all I can say is that it is just like thee, for a stupid
obstinate mule as thou art.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our mission was to civilize the whiskered and shirt-collared
heathen. The light of wisdom had been too long concealed from
the outer world by the Great Wall. Thou mayst remark it was
odd we never thought of civilizing them till we heard of their
finding gold—gold limitless as the glories of the empire! here and
in their other settlement of Aus-tra-lee-ah.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such a remark, oh, Tee-Tee! would be just about as sensible as
thy remarks usually are.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was because the barbarians had found this gold they stood in
need of our assistance more than ever. Could such people be expected
to know the use of wealth; I ask—could they? And as
for once in my life in addressing thee, I can have all the talk to
myself—without waiting for thy doubtless illogical reply—I answer,
No, they couldn't.</p>

<p><em>An Exraordinary Movement in China—or an alteration in "The Willow Pattern"—at last!!</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>It became our duty, at all hazards, to teach them. We resolved,
even at the pain of leaving our homes and wives (it's no use thy
getting into a passion, oh, Tee-Tee!), to go forth amongst them,
and accept the presents of gold and treasures they would doubtless
be too glad to lay at our feet, in exchange for that intellectual
wealth which we alone are capable of dealing out with a layish
hand. At any rate we could prevent their doing much mischief—by
taking the treasures from them.</p>

<p class='c000'>But they are such a set of fools!</p>

<p class='c000'>Our words of wisdom they receive with mocking laughter, or by
calling on their idols to send down curses on our eyes and limbs.
So ignorant are they, that they have no fear of the Emperor before
their eyes; and tell us, if we want gold we must dig for it.</p>

<p class='c000'>And this is our reward! Of course digging, for a true-souled
Chinaman, is out of the question. In the first place, we should
have to cut our nails. In the second place, we should have to exert
ourselves. In the third place, one process indispensable to the work
of gold-seeking is called washing—a revolting idea!</p>

<p class='c000'>The result is, that did we not, in our superior wisdom, know the
value of rat and puppy (which the barbarians despise), the chop-sticks
of your Poo Poo and his companions would be unoccupied.</p>

<p class='c000'>We are not alone, however, in our misfortunes. There are several
men here of a superior tribe—which I think I have heard called
Dan-dees—who, like ourselves, have been trained in the ways of
wisdom, to despise mere physical labour, and think only of Man's
superiority as evidenced in their own persons; who came like ourselves,
expecting to be received with rich gifts and open arms by
the drudging savages, whose wilderness they had condescended to
enlighten by their presence. These men are reviled and neglected
because they do not like to soil their hands—and have never learnt
to do anything!</p>

<p class='c000'>My paper is out; and as, I dare say, thou hast already forgotten
me, and taken up with that atrocious rascal, Tom Tom—to whom
thou wilt probably hand this letter for a pipe-light, without having
even looked at it—I need add no more than the signature of the
unfortunate</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The English, climate, so long considered a capital joke, is becoming
a very serious matter. They were not Dog-Days last summer;
they were Hyæna, Kangaroo, Elephant, Boa-Constrictor days.</p>

<p class='c000'>If so unnatural a state of things is to be repeated, England will
no longer occupy her present position in the world. She will be
somewhere else. There will be no place like home. Home itself
will not bear the slightest resemblance to it. We shall be all
abroad—every British child will be born a foreigner.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nationality will be at an end. With the loss of our climate, on
which the British Constitution so closely depends, it is impossible
that we should continue to be the same people.</p>

<p class='c000'>What will avail the boast that Britons never never shall be
slaves, when there is such an immediate likelihood of their becoming
niggers?</p>

<p class='c000'>Our isolated position makes the prospect all the more alarming.
The country must be in a continual state of hot water.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Comic is not, strictly speaking, a Weather Almanack. Still
the heat of last summer made us so uncomfortable (we do not
mean merely in a physical sense), that we thought it our duty to
inquire into the matter. We have, therefore, condescended on this
occasion to look into futurity with a weather eye, of which we
hasten to present the reader with a few "shoots,"—such, we
believe, being the term usually applied to the natural emanations
from the eyes of a Murphy.</p>

<p class='c000'>We regret to say our worst fears have been confirmed. The
page in the Book of Destiny that has been opened to our inspection
is closely printed, and presents the aspect of a number of the
<cite>Times</cite>, dated August 2nd, 1980. We leave our readers to form
their own opinions on the following extracts:—</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>The Weather and the Crops.</span>—The season continues to be
unusually backward. The plantains in the neighbourhood of
Wolverhampton have scarcely passed the flower. The cotton
fields, however, of the West Riding are in a healthy condition—several
trees being already in pod. It is feared that there will be
a great loss in consequence of the dearth of labourers. It is true
that immigration from Iceland, Nova Zembla, and the manufacturing
countries generally, continues to a great extent; but
nothing can atone for the impossibility of arousing the native slave
population to exertion. The prospects of sugar are far from satisfactory,
the siroccos of the last month having completely devastated
the plantations—the canes on Clapham Common present a disastrous
spectacle! The bread-fruit trees on Blackheath promise an
abundant supply of half-quarterns.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span><span class='sc'>Frightful Accident.</span>—On Wednesday last, Mr. Edward Jackson,
landlord of the "Cocoa-Nut," Tottenham Court Road, having
had the imprudence to bathe in the Serpentine, was attacked by a
ferocious alligator, who devoured both his legs so as to make
amputation, we regret to say, unnecessary.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Enormous Palm Cabbage.</span>—A gigantic specimen of this national
plant grown in the open air by a native slave named Higgins, in
the little garden attached to his shanty, was exhibited on Tuesday
at the meeting of the Agricultural Society. It measured six feet
in circumference, and weighed twenty-three pounds four ounces.
A medal was awarded to the grower, and was accepted by the
Rajah Simpson, his owner, whose family subsequently dined off
the cabbage, expressing themselves highly gratified.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Sporting Intelligence.</span>—His Majesty's elephants threw off
yesterday from Richmond Park at four o'clock in the morning (the
absurd old-world custom of sporting and transacting business in
the heat of the day having, we are happy to say, exploded among
the intelligent classes); a fine tiger was scented in the jungles of
Slave Common, and soon broke cover. The run was a short one.
"Puss" was brought to bay among the bamboos of Isleworth
swamp, and speared by Coolies Walker and Smithers (eating, by
the way, a considerable portion of the latter). His Majesty was in
at the death, and returned to tiffin at 8 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Sir Charles Darling</span> (the Ladies' Candidate), presented himself
on the hustings amidst a general waving of handkerchiefs, and spoke
as follows:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Ladies and—(with a smile)—need I say gentlemen? (Titters and
"Droll creature!") I think not. Gallantry forbids my recognising
their existence—in any light other than as the devoted slaves of
that divine sex, of whom I am proud to esteem myself the humblest.
(Cries of "How nice!")</p>

<p class='c000'>Ladies, then, angels, goddesses ("Oh!" from an elderly bachelor,
who was removed by the police), for the thrilling position in which
I am placed, how can I be sufficiently grateful to that glorious reform
in our electoral system, which has partially recognised the
true position of lovely woman? ("Partially!" in a tone of sarcasm,
from a member of Mr. Screwdriver's committee). My honourable
and <em>gallant</em> friend objects to the adverb. I say <em>partially</em>, for by
admitting the ladies to the Franchise <em>with</em> the gentlemen, they are
but recognised as <em>equals</em>, instead of <em>superiors</em>. (Great sensation.)
Yes, ladies, and it shall be my earnest endeavours as your representative
("Yah!" and "Not yet!" from Mr. Screwdriver). My
honourable and <em>gallant</em> friend observes "Not yet." It is true I have
a formidable rival to contend with. The charms of his person,
(screams, and "the Old Fright!") his known politeness, above all
his taste in dress (here the laughter and clapping of kid gloves rendered
the speaker inaudible for some moments)—compared with such
claims, mine are worthless ("Do listen!" and "The Duck!"), extending
no farther than a willingness, I may say a downright anxiety,
to die in the cause of the fair creatures, who, I believe I may say,
have done me the honour to elect me as their champion ("Yes!
Yes!") With the ladies' voices in my favour, I believe I need not
fear those of the gentlemen being exerted against me. (Cries of
"We should like to see them," "Speak up, Alfred, do," "I'm
ashamed of you," &amp;c.) I thank you, gentlemen—or rather I do not
thank you; I honour you for your—may I say obedience? ("Oh yes!"
in a rapturous tone, from the engaged gentlemen), though, after all,
I don't see how you were to help yourselves. (Great applause, and
numerous bouquets thrown.)</p>

<p class='c000'>The Honourable Mrs. Poser stepped forward, and begged to be
allowed to address a few questions to the candidate.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. Poser.</em> What are Sir Charles's views with regard to the
existing Excise regulations?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sir Charles.</em> My first measure will be to bring in a bill legalizing
the smuggling of laces and French ribbons. (Rapturous cheering.)</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span><em>A Voice.</em> About the Sanitary Movement?</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir Charles thought every family should leave town at the end of
the season. It was his opinion, that all husbands paying the income
tax should be compelled to take their wives and children to
the seaside for the autumn months. It should have his earliest
attention. In answer to another speaker, he considered that
Assembly-rooms should be maintained in every town by the public
purse.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. Poser.</em> What Foreign Policy will you advocate?</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir Charles would advocate peace with France at all hazards,
that nothing might endanger the immediate importation of Parisian
fashions. (<em>Cheers and bouquets.</em>)</p>

<p class='c000'><em>A Young Lady.</em> About the Army?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sir Charles.</em> I am for keeping up a standing army, to consist
entirely of regiments of horse-guards, composed exclusively of
officers. (<em>Immense sensation.</em>)</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. Poser.</em> I should like to hear your intentions as to the
tobacco duties.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sir Charles.</em> To prohibit the importation and cultivation of that
objectionable plant altogether, so that there may be no more
smoking.</p>

<p class='c000'>A show of parasols was demanded, and Sir Charles Darling was
declared duly elected.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>In the first place, I should like to know what they mean by
wearing those enormous fur hats? They may be an intelligent
people. All I know is—I never saw such a set of muffs as they
look in all my life. And such tight trousers! reducing the legs
of Young France to next to nothing, and presenting an appearance
of top-heaviness that is absolutely uncomfortable to contemplate.
They talk of their stable government! The heads of the nation
could never have been in a more tottering condition than they seem
now—and I don't see how things can possibly go on long on such
a slender footing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Why should such a difference exist between the civil and military
states? I have heard a great deal of the admirable discipline of
the French army; but in a great many regiments there appears to
be no recognisable head worth speaking of. Quite the contrary.
Are we indeed to believe the scandal that all the boasted cares and
energies of the saviours of France have only been directed to the
basest ends?</p>

<p class='c000'>This is the baker! The circular article he holds in his right
hand is a loaf! So is the longitudinal ditto in his left! I am at a
loss to account for the singular expedients
resorted to by the French
for making their bread. It is true
that one species possesses the great
recommendation, to the heads of
families, of going a very long way.
But, on the contrary, the other is a
description of food which the
smallest child could get through in
no time.</p>

<p class='c000'>This gentleman is supposed to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>conducting himself in this remarkable
manner from an
excess of enjoyment and high
spirits; the French, generally,
being supposed to be a gay
and light-hearted people. Does a close
inspection of the expression of the gentleman's
countenance, in the height of his
hilarity, warrant either supposition?
Would it not rather be thought that he is
performing a terrible act of penance for
some sin that can never be wholly expiated?</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_586b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>They have policemen in Paris, I suppose. Indeed I know they
have. Why, then, is so strong a detachment of the military necessary
to conduct that little boy to prison? Is it that the civil officers
are less to be trusted with a service of danger than our own
gallant Blues, or that juvenile delinquency exists in France to an
extent unknown in our favoured clime?</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>Who is <em>he</em>, I wonder!!!</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I should like to know why the French can't allow their trees to
grow as they like, instead of cropping and clipping them, like so
many whiskers on the face of Nature. These singular-looking ter-restrial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>spheres, planted in square tubs, in the Luxembourg
Gardens, I am told are orange-trees. Very good. Their resemblance
to oranges is certainly striking. I should be happy to accept
their appropriate rotundity as a precedent for the invariable rule
(as having an instructive tendency), but that, on inspection, I do
not find the neighbouring groves to consist of pear-trees as, judging
from appearances, I was induced to imagine.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_587a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The French, I am told, down to the lowest grades of society, are
proverbial for their gallantry and consideration for the fair sex.
Appearances are certainly deceptive; but there is no trusting to
them in Paris. For instance, these individuals, I have ascertained,
belong to the class <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ouvrier</span></i>:—</p>

highest indignation with, or rather without, respect to his shoe-maker

that he (our friend) was the only customer he had left. We remarked
that we could see nothing reprehensible in his conduct—especially
as all his former patrons had deserted him. "What are
his former patrons to me?" exclaimed our friend; "I am the only

</div>

<p class='c008'>We hear a great deal of the prevalence of discontent in the navy.
It is said that the sailors are constantly grumbling at the way
they are treated, in the matter of unwholesome food and unsafe
ships.</p>

<p class='c000'>A great many suggestions have been offered as to the best remedy
for this evil. Some weak-minded practical persons have proposed
fresh provisions and new ships.</p>

<p class='c000'>We propose a <span class='sc'>Dibdin</span>!</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a notorious fact, that the late Charles Dibdin, during the
war, did the State great service by his sea songs, which had the
effect of persuading the British sailor that fighting was a very jolly
thing; that Frenchmen ought to (and might easily) be exterminated;
and that all the unpleasantness of a tempest might be satisfactorily
overcome by climbing up into the rigging and thinking of an absent
Sue or Polly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Why not employ a competent person to do something of the same
kind in the present day? It would be much better to reconcile the
British seaman to existing hardship, than to encourage a mutinous
and dissatisfied spirit. Of course, we put removing the difficulty
out of the question, as totally opposed to all precedent.</p>

dear, dear, dear! it's enough to drive anybody crazy
with all the trouble I've had with the huzzies the nasty good-for-nothing,
idle, lazy—the wicked presumptuous bad creatures, to
think of their taking such a start. Don't talk to me, Piper; it's
the fault of you men for taking their part. Can't blame them indeed
for wanting to better their situations!—of course my servants
were <em>very</em> ill used I understand your insinuations. No doubt it's
a treat to you to see your poor wife made into a slave—not that
there's any novelty in that I wish I was in my grave!—melted to
death and getting into such a mess with the chances <em>I</em> have of
even getting a new dress—at those dratted chops for you to guzzle.
If you had the feelings of a man, you'd do something to help me.
Oh! I daresay you're doing all you can—a pretty kettle of fish
you're making of the Irish stew. Ah! there goes the poker on to
the plates—don't tell me—you do it on purpose—you do. I didn't
say you touched the poker but you do all you can to flurry me in
one way or other—Tom, you naughty, unfeeling boy, how dare you
join in the conspiracy against your poor mother? If your father's
burnt you, it's just like him go and rub your hand with soap—though
you'll be clever to find it—Yes—Mr. Piper, you're satisfied
now, I hope—with your institutions and lectures and South
Australia panoramas I wish Mr. Prout and all the rest of the
wretches at the Polytechnic were pounded to death with sledge-hammers—putting
notions of emigration into the heads of a set of
brazen faces—but they've been a great deal too well treated, or
they would not have had time to go to such places; and those
newspapers talking about their rights and freedom if they'd minded
their work they wouldn't have had time to read 'em. In my poor
dear mother's time, no servant could get a place who knew how to
read. Ought to be treated like human beings? a pretty story, indeed!
I know what you mean Piper you needn't try to keep your
gravity—but they were always thinking of husbands and settling
in life or some such depravity.</p>

Piper that we <em>don't</em> get on as well without her as if I wanted her to
go, the viper! when she knew the whole comfort of the family depended
on her staying to be off to Australia the ungrateful thing
she deserves flaying. With the beautiful kitchen she had only she

farm and want to be some scamp's wife—never thinking what I've

a dish this minute do. What! do you mean to say there's only one

can do, Mr. Piper you may get your dinner yourself. If the chops
are black I can't help it well you needn't mention it—I see—if
there's one on the floor you may pick it up. Ah! I knew how it

<h3 class='c007'>ANSWER TO CORRESPONDENTS.</h3>

<p class='c036'><span class='sc'>Snikmit.</span>—Your conundrum was received in 1846, and has been in type ever
since. We shall probably be able to find room for it in the course of a few
years. Do not be impatient. We have all had our beginnings.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Walter the Doubter.</span>—The circulation of the <em>Comic Almanack</em> is eight millions.
The editor's salary is ten thousand a year. But these things are not
done for money.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='fss'>J.</span>—Your offer has had our most careful consideration. We fear that a novel
in ten books, each containing eighty chapters, to be published at the rate of
a chapter per year, will scarcely suit our publication. It would be difficult to
sustain the interest for so long a period and at such considerable intervals.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Worrit.</span>—There are three thousand and ninety-five editions of <em>Uncle Tom's
Cabin</em> published. It is estimated that every adult Briton has purchased nine
copies of that remarkable work and read them all.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Julianetta</span> says she could love us madly if she could make up her mind to
believe that we don't dye our whiskers. We do.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Rum Dickey</span> assures us he is just the fellow for our money. He is very clever
at finding out conundrums; knows three comic songs; and has a friend who
is intimate with an Ethiopian serenader. We will think of it.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Walkinshaw.</span>—Our pay is nineteen and sixpence per line for prose—two
guineas for verse; only we don't accept contributions.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Wapshot</span> informs us that he has occupied all his leisure hours for the last
twelve months in trying to find out the rebus, signed "Lilly," in last year's
<em>Comic Almanack</em>. He hopes, after all the trouble he has taken, we will not
publish any other answer to it till his arrives. We pledge him our honour.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Enquiros</span> wishes us to inform him the day of the month, and in what year,
Julius Cæsar landed in Britain; the number of lines in the <em>Iliad</em>; what we
consider the best receipt for tartar in the teeth; whether Mrs. Glover ever
played Ophelia or not in early life—and if she did, at what theatre, and to
whose Rosencrantz; how he had better set to work to obtain a commission
in the army without interest; if A pegs one too many by accident, has B a
right to score four; which year's volume of the <em>Little Warbler</em> we would
recommend for general purposes, in preference to the others; and if we know
of a good shop for elastic trousers. Perhaps some of our readers will oblige
him with an answer.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
